			<emu_comment>All killer No filler is a gamelist by BadMouth.  The games are listed per genre for people who are interested in quality over quantity.[CR]Yes, it's subjective.  This is not about listing every game in a genre.  That would put us right back up to scrolling through thousands of games, most of which suck.[CR]Arcade games only.[CR]Plain old joystick controls only.[CR]You may think not every game on these lists is "killer", but it sounds better than "you probably won't miss any games not on this list because they are either redundant in respect to games already on the list or they just aren't that good"</emu_comment>

				<plot>Asteroids Deluxe (c) 1981 Atari, Incorporated.[CR]Asteroids Deluxe is a 1 or 2-player game with an X-Y or vector-generator monitor. The game depicts a third-person view of a player's spaceship battling to destroy asteroids, flying saucers and enemy ships or 'death stars' (shaped like clusters of triangles). When hit, the asteroids and death stars will break into progressively smaller pieces. [CR]Players can put up an octagon-shaped 'shield' to temporarily protect their spaceship. However, this shield wears out with use. [CR]Large asteroids appear and drift in from the outer edges of the display. By pressing the ROTATE LEFT and ROTATE RIGHT pushbuttons on the control panel, the player may aim a spaceship toward any of the asteroids. The player uses the FIRE pushbutton to shoot at the asteroids and other objects. [CR]When shot, each large asteroid divides into two medium-sized asteroids, and the game adds 20 points to the player's score. Medium-sized asteroids, when shot, divide into two small-sized asteroids, and the game awards 50 points to the player. When shot the smallest asteroid disappears and the game adds 100 points to the player's score. [CR]In addition to asteroids, the players can score points for shooting the various enemy ships. When hit, the large ships ('death stars' shaped like hexagons) score 50 points and break into three diamond shapes. The medium-sized enemy or diamond, when hit, grants the player 100 points and breaks into two small triangular pieces. These small pieces disappear when the player hits them, and the score increases by 200 points. [CR]At any time during game play, a flying saucer may appear from either side of the display. The game awards players 200 points for shooting a large saucer and 1,000 points for a small saucer (the latter is a smaller target for players, though not any faster moving than the large one. It also shoots more accurately). [CR]The player's objective in the game is to shoot and destroy as many asteroids, saucers, and enemy ships as possible before all his or her spaceships are destroyed. A ship is destroyed if an asteroid, saucer or enemy ship smashes into it, or if a flying saucer shoots it. To prevent losing a ship, the player may press the THRUST pushbutton to move out of the path of an oncoming object. [CR]As an emergency maneuver, a player can press the Shields button. An octagon will then appear around the player's ship as protection from all enemies. For challenge the shield power lasts only about 10 seconds, but the power is renewed with each ship. The amount of shielding power available is shown by the brightness of the octagon (dim means almost exhausted power). [CR]- CAST OF CHARACTERS - [CR]Spaceship - This is you, the player. You can rotate 360 degrees, fire bullets, thrust forward in any direction, and use the shields if you feel you are in danger. [CR]Large Asteroid - These are the large rocks that fill the screen at the beginning of each stage. Hitting one with a bullet will break it apart in to two Medium Asteroids. [CR]Medium Asteroid - Slightly smaller than Large Asteroids, but faster moving, shooting one of these will result in two Small Asteroids. [CR]Small Asteroid - These are the smallest and fastest rocks on the screen. If a bullet hits one of these, it will vaporize. [CR]Hexagon - This addition to Asteroids appears when the stage is nearly free of rocks. It floats in one direction until it is shot. [CR]Diamond - When the Hexagon is shot it breaks up in to three separate diamonds. These begin to track and slowly follow you. [CR]Triangle - When a Diamond is shot it breaks up in to two separate triangles. These will move very quickly and zero in on you if you don't destroy them fast enough. [CR]Large Saucer - Large flying saucers appear on the screen from time to time, randomly firing shots around the screen. Approximately one out of every four shots will be aimed directly at your ship. They will also target Hexagons if any are on the screen at the same time. [CR]Small Saucer - The small saucers are deadlier than the large variety. They are much more precise with their shots, and are more likely to kill you. Eliminate them quickly or get out of their range.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]This particular machine was released in three different formats; an upright, a cabaret, and a cocktail, with the upright being the most common, and the cabaret being the least common. All three versions were nearly pin compatible with an original "Asteroids" board-set, only a few wires had to be swapped.[CR]* The upright was a rather interesting looking design that actually bulged out toward the player from the control panel on up. Atari went all out with the side-art on this one, it completely covers the sides from the floor to the top of the machine (it is a scene of a ship in an asteroid field, similar to the one on "Asteroids", but more detailed). The control panel layout is a little more subdued than the red, white, and blue monstrosity on the original "Asteroids". Just a dark surface, a few instructions, and some buttons (this title, like the original, did not use a joystick, although it plays well with one).[CR]* The cocktail version was almost identical in appearance to the original "Asteroids" cocktail (and just about every other Atari cocktail). It was black and woodgrain, with only a minimum of ornamentation behind the glass.[CR]* The cabaret version (a cabaret is a mini upright that is less than five feet tall), is an ugly little creature, with woodgrain sides and a black front. The nameplate is down low on the machine near the coin mechs (which makes the game hard to identify at first).[CR]* Upright dimensions : 71in. (180.34cm) high x 26,75in. (67.95cm) wide x 25.25in.

[CR]The original "Asteroids" proved to be wildly popular, but there was one problem. The game was simply too easy for expert players (many people could play for hours on a single quarter). So Atari decided to make a more difficult sequel, Asteroids Deluxe. They succeeded a little too well, and had to scale the difficulty back after their initial version proved to be too difficult for the average player. This game was created out of modified "Asteroids" code. At the same time this game was being produced, "Space Duel" was in the works, but was shelved as Asteroids Deluxe was green-lighted for production. Despite its similarities to the hugely popular original, Asteroids Deluxe was a commercial flop and Atari later released "Space Duel" to moderate success. [CR]Asteroids Deluxe features modified game-play intentionally designed to challenge players who had mastered the original "Asteroids" : [CR]1) The addition of new ships. When hit, the large ships ('death stars' shaped like hexagons) break into three diamond shapes. The medium-sized enemy or diamond, when hit, breaks into two small triangular pieces. These small pieces disappear when the player hits them. The diamond and triangular ships pursue the player's ship until killed. [CR]2) The small and large UFO's have been improved : [CR]a) Their shots now 'wrap-around' the screen. This means that a shot fired off the right or left side will re-enter the screen on the left or right side. [CR]b) The accuracy of the large UFO's shots have been improved. Now every one out of four shots are aimed at the player's spaceship. If there are no other targets, all shots go toward the player's spaceship. [CR]3) The player's ship was redesigned to include two side fins and a narrower body, keeping the overall ship dimensions identical to the original game. The ship has the same maximum velocity as in "Asteroids", but can accelerate twice as fast. [CR]4) The high score now 'rolls over' at 999,999 points instead of 99,999 points. [CR]5) A graphic overlay has been added to give the game more of a feeling of depth. It also makes it slightly harder to see the vector graphics. [CR]6) The hyperspace button has been replaced by a shield. The shield lasts 10-12 seconds per spaceship and cannot be recharged. [CR]7) Firing is now automatic, holding down the fire button will release a maximum of four shots (on screen) at a time. [CR]Although the attract screen claims a 1980 copyright, the game was officially introduced in March of 1981. The front glass on the upright was originally square with the cabinet - this produced an unpleasant 'glare' on the screen. Atari later released a 'glare reduction kit' which provided an angled glass frontage to be fitted onto the cabinet thereby reducing the glare. Once applied, the kit enclosed the speaker which resulted in deeper base tones. [CR]Approximately 22,300 units were produced. [CR]John McAllister hold the official record for this game with 3,333,360 points set February 12, 2009. [CR]An Asteroids Deluxe unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron', in the 1982 movie 'The Thing' and in the 1984 movie 'Night of the Comet'. [CR]An Asteroids Deluxe upright cabinet appears in the Judas Priest music video 'Freewheel Burning'. [CR]In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]There are two versions of the software; the original release proved to be so difficult that Atari released a revised version that had easier game-play. This new version was originally introduced in Europe and is often referred to as the 'European Version'. Determining the version can be discerned by noting the first appearance of a 'death star' - in the original version this is near the end of the second wave; in the revised version it appears near the end of the first wave and moves much more slowly.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Large Asteroids : 20 points[CR]Medium Asteroids : 50 points[CR]Small Asteroids : 100 points[CR]'Death Star' (Hexagon Shaped Ship) aka 'Snowflake' : 50 points[CR]Diamond Shaped Ship : 100 points[CR]Triangular Shaped Ship : 200 points[CR]Large Saucer : 200 points[CR]Small Saucer : 1,000 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your spaceship will be in the middle of the screen with four large asteroids heading toward your ship. After all the rocks are destroyed, the next round begins. The number of initial large asteroids depends on the round number : [CR]Round 1 : 4 [CR]Round 2 : 5 [CR]Round 3 : 6 [CR]Round 4 : 7 [CR]Round 5 : 8 [CR]Round 6 and up : 9 [CR]Your job is to blast those rocks, however, when you blast them, they break up into two medium rocks. Blasting a medium rock gives you two small rocks. Note : There is an exception to this rule. The game program only allows 24 asteroids on the screen at any one time. If the screen already contains 24 asteroids of any size, then when you shoot a large asteroid it breaks up into only one medium asteroid, and when you shoot a medium asteroid it breaks up into only one small asteroid. You can completely destroy a large asteroid with only three shots instead of seven when the screen is filled up like this. [CR]In addition, you have to contend with large and small saucers and the 'death stars'. On the first couple of screens, you can sit in the middle and blast rocks. Be aware that a saucer will enter which will cause you to move lest you be hit by its shots. In addition : [CR]1) You can have four shots on the screen at any one time. This is useful for when you are blasting rocks at close range. You can pretty much drill them to dust. [CR]2) Your shots 'wrap around' the screen. This means any shot that goes past the edge of the screen will reappear on the opposite side traveling the same direction. The saucers also have 'wrap around' shots. [CR]* After 10,000 points, the small saucer becomes a permanent part of the game. You can no longer sit in one place since the small saucer is able to track your ship and take you out with the first or second shot. [CR]* Your shields have a maximum life expectancy of 17 seconds. Each collision with a rock takes away about six seconds of shield time. Once your shield runs down, it can not be recharged. In other words : use your shields as little as possible. [CR]* Although there is danger from the rocks and saucers, you can also be a danger to yourself. Use the thrust carefully or you will find yourself careening out of control on the screen. Some players get really good, however, moving around and shooting. [CR]* For those desired high scores, you can use the hunting trick. It goes something like this : [CR]1) After 10,000 points, the small saucers appear. They are worth 1,000 points apiece. First, blast every rock until you have one small rock left. [CR]2) Go sit in the upper left or right corner of the game screen. [CR]3) If the small saucer appears from the side you are on, then you can blast it before it gets off a shot. If it appears on the opposite side, use the shot 'wrap around' to take care of it. Some people have done this for hours on end and racked up scores in the millions. Of course, it takes a long time at 1,000 points a pop. [CR]4) Also keep in mind that the small saucer can wrap shots so you may have to move out of danger. [CR]5) Unlike in "Asteroids", the small saucers fire a greater number of shots so hunting is more of a challenge. [CR]6) After 60,000 points, the accuracy of both UFO's goes up dramatically. [CR]* The 'death stars' make their appearance in either the first or second wave : [CR]1) It appears on the screen just lazily floating around. It can only be broken open by laser fire (yours or the saucer's). [CR]2) Once open, the pieces pursue the player. Hitting one of the diamond-shaped pieces breaks it into two triangular pieces. [CR]3) The best way to defeat this enemy is to accelerate forward, then turn quickly while shooting. This causes you to fly backwards while shooting at the pieces.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Classics Horiz - Berzerk</title_clean>
				<plot>Berzerk (c) 1980 Stern Electronics.[CR]The player controls the 'Humanoid' (colored green for player 1 and purple for player 2) and must negotiate a number of robot-filled rooms; each with up to as many as eleven, laser-firing enemy robots. The Humanoid can be killed either by a single shot from a robot, by running into a robot, by running into a wall of the maze, or by being touched by the player's nemesis, 'Evil Otto'.[CR]To advance through the game, players must fight their way through each room to an opening at one of the far walls. Each robot destroyed is worth 50 points and while it's possible to progress without killing every robot in each room; destroying all of them will earn the player a per-maze bonus (worth ten points per robot). The game has an impressive 64,000 mazes, with each level designed to be more difficult than the last.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]The Berzerk cabinet was the first in a series of cabinets from Stern that had a patented pull out drawer that allowed access to the games circuit boards from the front of the cabinet. This title features rather primitive painted side-art that only uses two colors, but it makes up for it with the awesome comic book style art on the control panel and monitor bezel. The marquee is only a 'Berzerk' logo, and it kind of looks like something that someone might have done in their high school airbrush class.[CR]Berzerk is technically a monochrome game. It uses a special 'color overlay' circuit board to add color to the games graphics before they go to the monitor. A side effect of this is that walking very close to a wall will cause that section of the wall to change to your color.[CR]Berzerk, in common with other machines commonly thought to have used samples (such as Atari's "Star Wars", "Paperboy" and "Gauntlet") used LPC encoded speech and a dedicated speech synthesizer. So the speech is technically encoded data for this speech synth, rather than the now far simpler, digitized audio 'samples' for play back via a DAC.[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80[CR]Sound Chips : Custom tone generator, custom LPC speech synthesis chip[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Berzerk was released in October 1980 in the USA.[CR]Alan McNeil, an employee of Universal Research Laboratories (a division of Stern Electronics), had a dream one night involving a black-and-white video game in which he had to fight robots. This dream, with heavy borrowing from the BASIC game 'Robots' ('Daleks' in the UK), was the basis for Berzerk. The idea for a black-and-white game was abandoned when the color game "Defender" was released earlier the same year to significant success. At that point Stern decided to use a color overlay board for Berzerk. A quick conversion was made, and all but the earliest versions of the game shipped with a color CRT display. The game was test-marketed successfully at a Chicago singles bar before general release.[CR]The title of the game comes from the series of books called 'The Berzerker Stories' by Fred Saberhagen. It's a novel about robots which go Berzerk and kill everybody.[CR]Berzerk is the first robot killing game but the big selling point of Berzerk was speech.[CR]From Tony Miller : "The speech was done using LPC coding that I believe was invented by T.I., although I remember we used a National Speech chip in it.  This was when speech and memory was expensive, so we didn't just digitize sounds and dump them out through a DAC. I remember it cost something like $1000 per word to have the compression done, so we tried to come up with a limited vocabulary which could be rearranged and reused as much as possible.There was some guy up in Silicon Gulch who did this stuff for a living - so it is possible to make money while talking in a monotone.".[CR]The Artist Richard D. James, using his alter ego Caustic Window, has the sample : 'Humanoid must not escape' from this game in his song with the same name as the sample. It's from the album 'Caustic Window Compilation'.[CR]Berzerk was also the first game to attempt a bit of on-screen comedy. Your robot opponents often fell foul of slapstick misfortune, shooting each other in the head or walking into walls and exploding in their attempts to kill you. And if you legged it out of a room without killing them all, the survivors would taunt you in their Speak &amp; Spell voices : "Chicken! Fight like a robot!". Okay, it's not hilarious, but even Bob Monkhouse had to start somewhere. Sometimes when you escape as above, it will just utter "Chicken".[CR]'Evil Otto' was named for 'Dave Otto', who worked for Dave Nutting's Arcade Engineering group as R &amp; D director at the time Alan McNeil did. 'Evil Otto' can be considered one of the most intimidating video game villains of all time. He is, and even travels through walls, preventing a player from loafing in the room. He resembles a bouncing smiley face, and has been called a 'Malicious basketball' by some.[CR]Berzerk was Stern's first major video game success. It was made in both upright (approx. 37500 units) and cocktail (approx. 1200 units) models. Berzerk suffered a bit in sales due to frequent breakdowns of it's original giant sized optical 8-way joystick. Approximately 4200 orders were canceled by distributors and operators whose machines were frequently down from the opto-stick. Stern issued free WICO leaf switch sticks to operators after they had so much trouble with the optical stick, but this still hurt sales.[CR]Berzerk shares a rather chilling distinction of being the first known game to be blamed for an actual player's death. In January 1981, Jeff Dailey was the first person to die playing a video game, a 19-year old Berzerk player, died of a massive heart attack right after playing his favorite game. His score was 16,660 (a very respectable score but disturbing for obvious reasons). On an equally distressing note, in October 1982 at the 'Friar Tuck Game Room' in Calumet City, Illinois : 18-year old Peter Burkowski, a physically healthy person who was alcohol-free and drug-free, inscribed his initials in Berzerk's top ten list twice in a matter of only 15 minutes. A few seconds after that, he collapsed and died of a heart attack.[CR]In Retrogamer Issue #47, Alan McNeil addressed these legends, and has a different perspective: "...one player did die while playing the game (Alan refutes reports that claim two died). The unfortunate fellow was obese and had run upstairs to play the game", Alan explains: "The legend is he set a high score and died, but the owner of the arcade said he didn&#8217;t finish the game &#8211; he was out of breath from the moment he arrived until he dropped. The legend is way better than reality: the excitement of playing a game killing a player after setting a high score..."[CR]Steve Wagner holds the official record for this game on the 'Fast Bullets' setting with 350340 points on March 12, 2009.[CR]Phil Younger holds the official record for this game on the 'Slow Bullets' setting with 304570 points on August 12, 2007.[CR]A Berzerk unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Tron' and in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.[CR]A Berzerk unit appears in the ZZ Top music video 'Legs'.[CR]Milton Bradley (MB) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1983. 'Can You Survive the Frenzied Attack of the Robot Army?' In this board game version, 2 players face off. One player controls the Humanoid and the other player controls Evil Otto and the robots. Players alternate sides for a maximum of three rounds or until both have been zapped three times and destroyed as the Humanoid. Humanoid lives are represented by chips placed in front of the player. Each time a player's Humanoid is zapped, the player surrenders one chip. Once a player loses all three chips, that player's Humanoid is destroyed, and therefore he/she cannot control the Humanoid for the rest of the game. The object of the game is to zap more robots while controlling the Humanoid than your opponent.[CR]Berzerk inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Goin' Berzerk' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album, here are the full lyrics! :[CR]Humanoid - This is you.  [CR]You can move in eight directions.[CR]Once you start you're never done.[CR]You can go from room to room,[CR]You can crawl or you can run.[CR]You can wander through the maze.[CR]It's a wonderland at night,[CR]You can stop and aim your gun when,[CR]there's a robot in your sights.[CR]Robots - The various colored robots.[CR]I think I'm going berzerk.[CR]I think I'm losing my mind.[CR]I'm getting lost in the shuffle.[CR]It happens every time.[CR]I think I'm going berzerk.[CR]Would you like to come to?[CR]I can't stop now - I'm addicted![CR]I'm berzerk over you.[CR]Evil Otto - The bouncing smiley face.[CR]If we fight this thing together[CR]there's a chance that we might win.[CR]Now here comes Evil Otto,[CR]push the fire buttons in.[CR]I'm sure he's crazy too because [CR]he's bouncing off the floor.[CR]There's no way to destroy him , [CR]let him bounce right out the door.[CR]The speech, 'Humanoid' and 'Intruder Alert!' featured heavily in 1988's seminal UK Acid track, 'Stakker Humanoid' by later Future Sound of London member Brian Dougans. His use of distortion and slightly lower pitch, leaves the game sounding quite tame by comparison...[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Two different versions of the game were released. As a player's score increases, the colors of the enemy robots change, and the robots can have more bullets on the screen at the same time (once they reach the limit, they cannot fire again until one or more of their bullets detonates; the limit applies to the robots as a group, not as individuals). In the original version, the sequence goes :[CR]* Yellow robots that don't fire[CR]* Red robots that can fire one bullet[CR]* Light blue robots that can fire two bullets[CR]After 5,000 points Evil Otto doubles his speed, moving as fast as the player while robots remain in the maze, and twice as fast as the player after all the robots are destroyed.[CR]The revised version, which had the much larger production run of the two, features a longer color sequence that also included green, purple, and white robots. In this version, the robot sequence went up to five normal speed bullets, then they began firing fast bullets, starting with one fast bullet, and eventually going as high as seven fast bullets at once. After 20,000 points the robots stay light blue and may have up to seven fast bullets on screen for the remainder of play. To balance the greatly increased threat from the robots in this version, Evil Otto's pursuit speed remains at its normal (half or equal the player's speed) level throughout.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]You get 50 points per robot destroyed. It doesn't matter whether you destroy them or they get destroyed some other way.[CR]You get a bonus of 10 times the number of robots in a maze if you clear it For example, if you destroyed all 7 robots in a maze, then your bonus would be 10 X 7 or 70 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Here is how the rounds progress in the revised version : [CR]Points - Robot Color - Shots fired [CR]0-260 -Yellow - 0[CR]260-1200 - Red - 1[CR]1200-3000 - Light Blue - 2[CR]3000-4500 - Green - 3[CR]4500-6000 - Purple - 4[CR]6000-8000 - Yellow - 5[CR]8000-10000 - White - One fast shot (2x speed)[CR]10000-12000 - Light Blue - Two fast shots[CR]This color system now repeats. At around 20000 points, the robots stay light blue. Starting at about 10000 points. Berzerk becomes largely a game of luck. If you get an open maze with a lot of robots, there is not much you can do.[CR]* When you start the game, the Humanoid will be put at the left entrance. (In a 2-player game, player 2's Humanoid will be put at the right entrance). You will face anywhere from 1 to 12 robots. Quickly assess where the Humanoid is at and destroy the closest robots. The first 3 sets of robots are pretty easy. It's when they start firing those 3+ shots at you or the supershots things can get bad.[CR]* Remember, the Humanoid is longer then he is wide; use this to your advantage. Always try to exit the maze from the left or right exit so that the Humanoid presents a small profile for the next maze. If you enter from the top or bottom, you presents a bigger target. Of course, there is no defense against being put right next to a robot.[CR]* There is a 1-2 second delay after you enter a maze before the robots come after you; use that to your advantage. [CR]* You cannot run and shoot at the same time in this game. You have to stop and shoot. Use the joystick to aim and press the FIRE button. The Humanoid may move a little in that direction so don't try to shoot robots point-blank or you will destroy the robot while the robot vaporizes you.[CR]* When you get into the later rounds, luck will be as much a factor as skill. This is especially true when the robots are firing supershots at you (these shots travel twice the speed of normal shots). [CR]* Evil Otto (the bouncing happy face) will appear from where the Humanoid entered the maze. Evil Otto's appearance is directly related to how many robots you start with. The lower the number, the sooner Evil Otto appears. Evil Otto cannot be destroyed.[CR]* Because the robots are attracted to you 'as the crow flies', they will tend to clump together and smash into each other. The best way to kill robots is to stand safely behind a wall and let them shoot and smash each other. The ball (Evil Otto) will also kill them. You can ignore some robots in the maze and let Otto kill them for you. Otto follows your position like the robots, so as he comes across the screen, lead him up and down into any remaining robots before you exit.[CR]* If the robot cannot hit you with laser fire, they will still try to kill the Humanoid by attempting to run him over. [CR]* The walls in the maze are deadly. If the Humanoid or a robot runs into a wall, he is vaporized. (You score the points if a robot is destroyed by running into a wall). The wall will light up if the Humanoid is too close to it. [CR]* If you and a robot are in line and firing at each other, your shots will negate themselves out. In the later levels, this could prove deadly since they can keep up with your firepower. [CR]* An Interesting Quirk : There is a one pixel space between the Humanoid's head and shoulders. The game doesn't register it as existing so if a robot's shot goes through that space, the Humanoid doesn't die. [CR]* The robots always walk toward you unless you're in their line of fire; then they will pause to shoot. There are eight directions you and they can shoot. The only way to survive the higher levels (10, 000 points +) is to learn the blind spots of the robots. If you are in a robot's blind spot he poses no threat, and you can concentrate on blasting the others. The angle shots are almost never necessary. It is very difficult to hit a robot with an angle shot. When you shoot, the Humanoid stops moving, when you can't move, you are vulnerable. Make your shots count and don't bother wasting your time with angles unless you are on an early level and need the practice. [CR]* Because the robots are shorter than you, try to avoid robots at the bottom edge of the screen. By the time you move low enough to get a shot they will have already fired. In contrast, if you come 'up' on robots from the bottom, you can shoot their feet and duck back down before their shot reaches you. [CR]* Because the Humanoid is a lot taller than he is wide, it is very easy to avoid shots from above and below. Take out the robots to the sides of you first. [CR]* If you poke your head above a wall just far enough to shoot above it, the robots on the other side of it can't shoot you. They will only hit the wall. ALWAYS use this tactic to kill most of the robots in a maze. When you are in the right position, just hold down the fire button. This will make the Humanoid stand still. You can inch your way very close to the deadly walls without fear of running into them. When shooting up or down, that trick doesn't work. If there is a wall between you and a robot above you, run to the right and start shooting up just past the wall. If you are lucky, the robot will walk into your fire before he gets a shot off. By design, if a robot is above you, he will lock into position directly in-line with your shots, and you will shoot each other's bullets. In early rounds you can overpower a robot and outgun him, but later the robots can keep up with you and you will be in a deadlock. To defeat him, shoot up and immediately walk to the right and he will walk into your bullet. [CR]* The robots are programmed to avoid colliding into the sides of the deadly walls, but they can't detect the start or end of a wall. If a robot is below the end of a wall, you can move up and direct him into the wall end. [CR]* In later rounds, all of the real action takes place in the first two or three seconds of a round. If you survive the initial shots from the robots, you are as good as done with the maze. When a new maze comes on screen, you are very vulnerable. Often you are in the line of fire of five robots. As the new maze slides on-screen, you can see it before the robots appear. Use this time to decide which way to run. Assume that there will be a robot in each 'room' or 'nook'. Shoot the robot right in front of you first, and then run toward his position. By running ahead, you will exit the line of fire of any robots above/below you and also the dreaded angle shots. Once you are out of their line of fire, you can re-enter their line of fire selectively and shoot them. Get to a safe barrier as soon as possible and wait for the robots to move into easy positions.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Berzerk (1980)[CR]2.

				<plot>Bosconian - Star Destroyer (c) 1981 Namco. [CR]Bosconian is a multi-directional space shooter where the player must destroy several enemy bases on each round while evading enemy ships, asteroids and mines. Enemy bases are destroyed either with a shot to the center or by shooting out all six base cannons. The player's ship is always positioned in the center of the screen with everything else scrolling around it as the player flies. A radar map to the right shows the position of the player, enemy bases, and occasional formation attack groups.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model] [CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (x3), MB88xx [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG, custom DAC (for speech), discrete circuitry (for the shot and explosions sounds)[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Bosconian was released in November 1981 in Japan.[CR]The subtitle 'Star Destroyer' appears exclusively on the game's title screen.[CR]Bosconian was famous for being the first game to have a continue feature. [CR]The 'Spy Ship' in this game also makes a cameo appearance in "Galaga" as one of the three "transform" ships. [CR]In the game "Ridge Racer", a car has this game as a sponsor. It is a white and red car named 'RT Bosconian'. Its sister car, from another Namco game is a white and blue car named 'RT Nebulasray'. They were used in "Ridge Racer", "Ridge Racer 2", "Ridge Racer 64", and "Ridge Racer DS". [CR]The origin of the keywords in Bosconian (as in the 'Zwilniks of Boskone') is the Lensman space-opera saga, which in Japan always enjoyed high popularity.

Both versions have the same Enemy Base setups, but they are in different order as the rounds go up. This is also true regarding where your fighter starts at. For example, the setup for Round 4 on the other versions is the same as the setup for Round 6 on the new Namco version.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Asteroid : 10 points[CR]Cosmo Mine : 20 points[CR]I-Type Missile (Looks like fighter) : 50 points[CR]P-Type Missile (Looks like boomerang) : 60 points[CR]E-Type Missile (Looks like Enemy Base Missile) : 70 points[CR]Spy Ship : 200 or 400 points[CR]Enemy Station Cannon : 200 points[CR]Enemy Station : 1,500 points[CR]Enemy Formation : 500, 1,000 or 1,500 points depending on missile type[CR]Control Fighter in Formation (The off-colored fighter) : 100, 120 or 140 points (twice the normal missile value)[CR]Bonus for no-miss clear (completing a round without dying) - this bonus is given only when the game is set to auto difficulty : multiplier x number of bases, the multiplier starts at 100 points and increases by 100 points each time you get the bonus up to 1,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Easter Egg :[CR]1) Enter service mode.[CR]2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Up(x5), Right(x6), Down, Left(x4). '(c) 1981 NAMCO LTD.' will be added at the bottom of the screen.[CR]* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game (the synthesized voice will state "Blast Off!" at the start of each new stage and each new life). Your fighter will be put on the screen. Your radar display will show how many space stations need to be taken out. The radar doesn't show, though, all the space debris all over the place and the enemy fighters (unless they are in formation). Your fighter stays in the middle of the screen.[CR]* Be aware that the enemy missiles are faster then your ship. This means you will have to learn to use the joystick proficiently so that you can maneuver away from these enemy missiles attempting to commit suicide on your ship.[CR]* At the beginning of the round, quickly look at your radar to determine where the Enemy Stations are. Then quickly figure out a systematic way of destroying them since time is one's enemy in this game. Just because they are lined up in a row doesn't mean that the missile bays are facing the same direction.[CR]* By that same token, your ship fires lasers from both the front and back. This means if anything is trying to 'sneak' up on you, they won't stand a chance.[CR]* Use the space debris to your advantage. You score points regardless of whether you hit the enemy, or if you use other means to assist, such as the mines or rocks.  Just keep in mind that the space debris doesn't return until the next round.[CR]* The Enemy Stations can be destroyed two ways :[CR]1) The first way is to fire a shot directly into their missile bay. This is easy to do on the first two rounds.  By round three, the missile bay has a door which opens and closes to make it more of a challenge. After round three, the station will fire a missile if your fighter is in the missiles path. You can easily destroy this missile with your ship.[CR]2) The other way is to destroy all six cannons around the space station. This method also enables you to get more points in the long run. To do this, though, means you will have to deal with more enemy missiles since you have to constantly loop around to hit the cannons. In addition, the pods fire back on your ship.[CR]* Enemy Stations can be oriented with the missile bay facing left/right or up/down. Keep this in mind if you are taking on multiple stations in one area. While you are pounding on one Enemy Station, three more may be firing at your ship to prevent you from destroying your target.[CR]* The warning conditions tell you how safe it is for the moment :[CR]1) GREEN means no enemies within view.[CR]2) YELLOW means enemies present.[CR]3) RED means that either you have taken too long or you failed to destroy the Spy Ship while it was within range, and the enemy is now moving twice as fast to ram you. [CR]* You will also hear synthesized voice prompts stating "Blast Off!" at the start of each new round, "Alarm! Alarm!" when enemies attack, "Battle Stations!" when an enemy formation approaches, "Spy Ship Sighted!" when the Spy Ship appears, and "Condition Red!" when you enter the red condition.[CR]* At regular intervals, a formation of enemy missiles will head toward your ship. You can see what the formation of these enemy missiles are in by looking at the area above the top, left corner of the radar. This will show you if they are in a line, checkerboard pattern, etc. You will also see this formation (represented by a red dot) on your radar screen. Some quick tips for tangling with formations :[CR]1) Enemy formations always appear as a control missile with four missiles.[CR]2) If you destroy the control missile, the other missiles will spread out. You can still destroy them but it is much harder to get the points for taking out the entire formation.[CR]3) Try to maneuver in such a way as to be able to rapidly hit all the missiles. This is of course barring the fact there is no other things (rocks and mines) in the way that can destroy these missiles. This works well when they are in a line. If they are in a checkerboard pattern, you will have to move back and forth so you can hit everything but the control missile.[CR]4) A synthesized voice stating 'Battle Stations' will announce when a formation is present.[CR]* As mentioned before, if you take too long to take out the Enemy Stations, the condition will go to RED and enemy missiles will pour into the area with the only intent of ramming your ship.  You will know this also by the sound the machine makes. [CR]* Continue to fly erratic patterns (unless you are going after Enemy Stations or formations) because the enemy missiles do move quicker then you do plus you will probably be able to take them out more effectively.[CR]* Just as in "Time Pilot", there is a way you can stay on a level for as long as you want (This works best on level 2) : Stay away from all the bases, and fly horizontally from left to right. Just fire continuously at all the formations that come at you. The other ships will never be able to come after you. There is no time limit in the game, and it never gets any harder.

				<title_clean>Classics Horiz - Bubbles</title_clean>
				<plot>Bubbles (c) 1982 Williams.[CR]In Bubbles you control a cartoon soap bubble inside a large sink. The object of the game is clean out the sink. You can safely scrub away ants, grease, and crumbs all the time. But sponges, roaches, brushes, and razor blades are deadly to a small bubble. Don't worry too much though, because your bubble grows in size as it swallows up the dirt in the sink. When it gets big enough it will be able to hit brushes and sponges (but still not razors).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Bubbles was available in four different cabinets - A standard wooden upright cabinet, a plastic DuraMold cabinet, a mini (or cabaret) cabinet, and a cocktail. All four different varieties are pretty rare. On top of there being four different cabinets, there were also two different ROM revisions (the 'Red' and 'Blue' revisions), making a grand total of eight different Bubbles machines. [CR]* The standard upright is in a dark blue cabinet (which is identical to one of the alternate "Robotron - 2084" cabinets). It is decorated with painted sideart of a bunch of bubbles coming up from a drain. The marquee matches the design of the sideart perfectly (a 'Bubbles' logo on a dark blue background, some of them also showed the main character, but many of them did not). The control panel features an 8-Way optical joystick that has an incredible feel, but is prone to breakage. [CR]* The DuraMold cabinet was a round cabinet made completely out of thick plastic. This was an experiment in making an indestructible arcade cabinet that would last forever. There were a few other DuraMold games made, but Bubbles was the most common one by far. The DuraMold Bubbles was a big blue plastic cylinder with no sideart. It had a curved marquee on top that had the same graphics as the standard upright. The control panel had the same joystick that the upright model used, but the graphics on it were more detailed (cartoon images of characters from the game, as opposed to a simple design). [CR]* The cabaret and cocktail models were identical in design to their "Robotron - 2084" counterparts. Both of these had very limited production runs. [CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : M6808 (@ 894.75 Khz) [CR]Sound Chips : DAC [CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 292 x 240 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.1 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 256[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]By 1983 it seemed every possible idea had been used in a video game except the kitchen sink. Then came Bubbles. [CR]'What I was trying to do with Bubbles was come up with a non-violent, clean game (no pun intended)' says John Kotlarik. The game was intended to be a "Pac-Man" inspired take-off with a free form play field instead of walls. Kotlarik came up with the initial concept and Python Anghelo created all the artwork and wrote the game scenario. [CR]Python had previously worked on many other Williams games, including much of the art for "Joust". Kotlarik had helped out on the sounds for "Joust" and "Defender", as well as creating the voice for Williams' first voice synthesized pinball game, "Gorgar". Together they brought the kitchen sink to life. [CR]The early '80s were an era populated with off the wall video game characters like Q*Bert, Dig Dug, and Mr. Do. Even then, the cast of Bubbles stood out from the crowd. The game had crumbs, ants, greasies, sponges, brushes and the Cleaning Lady. It was certainly the only game ever to create a character out of something as sinister and bizarre as a razor blade. Piloting your scrubbing bubble, the goal was to scour sink after sink of scurrying scum. [CR]The big challenge of programming the game was creating the drift movement of the free floating player bubble, which was a lot more complex than meets the eye. They wanted to program the bubble to move like it was on ice, or water, and not a hard surface track. To do this, Kotlarik had to do what he calls the damping of the velocity profile. The longer you held the joystick down, the faster you would go and experience a slight decrease in velocity once you started to coast. It was an attempt to make an analog control out of an eight way digital joystick. The game had different movement than any other immediate response game of its kind. [CR]Bubbles also had innovative cabinet design. The wood cabinet graphics, created by Anghelo, were some of the best of all the Williams classic games. Anghelo also came up with the concept for a unique all plastic cabinet for Bubbles. Mechanical engineer Gary Berge developed it by using a special rotational molding process. The shape was cylindrical with a domed top. The Bubbles cabinets were in blue plastic. Black plastic ones were created for "Blaster" and a handful of "Sinistar" test machines. The plastic cabinets were almost indestructible. When crushed, they would spring back to shape like an accordion. When blemished, they could easily be fixed by heating and smoothing the plastic. 'If we'd made kits for those things we could have easily sold a couple hundred thousand', says Tom Cahill of the Williams service department. [CR]Bubbles created a play environment like no other game of its time. The humorous animated action was a nice complement to Williams' cadre of famous sci-fi pulse racers. [CR]Yashiro Oda holds the official record for this game with 1,566,960 points on August 1, 1984.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]A little known strategy of the game is available once your bubble becomes large enough to have a face. The sponges and brush can no longer destroy it. Working from the right angle, a player can rack up extra points by shoving the sponges and brushes down the drain. The only drawback is that every time you throw your weight around in this manner you lose a little in size, until eventually you become vulnerable again.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Crumb: 100 points.[CR]Ants: 150 points.[CR]Greasie: 200 points (can be conquered if you collect the Cleaning Lady and gain her sweeping skill to bump it into the drain).[CR]Cleaning Lady: 500 points (will increase as she collects items).[CR]Roach: 1,000 points (can be conquered if you collect the Cleaning Lady and gain her sweeping skill to bump it into the drain). [CR]Dive Ahead Bonus: x 1,000 points per bubble enlargement.[CR]Around the Drain: x 2 points (if you get the above items around the drain).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Keep moving...you won't attract dirt if you just stand there. Also, Roaches are like heat-seeking missiles...they won't aimlessly wander because they WANT you.[CR]* Go around the circumference/perimeter of the sink first, since they are the easiest to collect. Then work your way inwards.[CR]* Dirt and crumbs will slowly head for thee drain so you could spin around the drain, collecting them as they come.[CR]* If the drain is flashing RED, back off! A Giant Ant/Roach is coming your way! Seek and capture the Cleaning Lady's broom (if there is one) to counter this threat.[CR]* Do not try to out-run Roaches, because they are actually faster than your poor, slow-poke Bubble. Instead, out-maneuver them. Go in circles around them and pick up materials in the process. Once you have a smile, bid the ugly duckling farewell and head for the drain before you get bitten![CR]* If there is a low supply of materials abroad and you're not even close to getting a smile on your face...don't get the materials because it would speed your death up. Instead, use the remaining time to wait for the green light and go in! It might take a while. Hell, maybe the light will never come...[CR]* DON'T BE SELFISH! You might want to try to collect more materials when you have a big, big smile on your face...it's not worth it. Take the safe road and go into the drain before someone kicks your head in.[CR]* Try to collect the items around the drain, you get double points that way.[CR]* Once you have a smile on your face, you can make the brushes/sponges bounce off without getting blown up. Try to aim them to the drain to add injury to the insilt![CR]* Not really a tip... but the number of the level you are currently playing is on the top left corner. Once it goes past 99, it comes back to 01.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Program, design and sounds by : John Kotlarik (JJK), Tim Murphy (TIM)[CR]Art and design by : Python Anghelo (ANG)[CR]Support software by : Dave Rzepka[CR]Hardware by : Chuck Bleich, Greg Wepner[CR]Mechanical by : Leo Ludzia, Gary Berge.[CR]Video manager : Ken Lantz[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Sega Saturn [US] (1996) "Arcade's Greatest Hits [Model T-9703H]" [CR]Sony PlayStation [US] (April 10, 1996) "Williams Arcade's Greatest Hits [Model SLUS-00201]" [CR]Sony PlayStation [EU] (September 1, 1996) "Williams Arcade's Greatest Hits [Model SLES-00323]" [CR]Sega Dreamcast [US] (June 27, 2000) "Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Vol. 1 [Model T-9713N]" [CR]Sega Dreamcast [EU] (July 28, 2000) "Midway's Greatest Arcade Hits Vol. 1 [Model T-9710D-50]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [US] (November 18, 2003) "Midway Arcade Treasures [Model SLUS-20801]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [US] (November 24, 2003) "Midway Arcade Treasures" [CR]Nintendo GameCube [US] (December 18, 2003) "Midway Arcade Treasures [Model DOL-GAKE-USA]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [EU] (February 6, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [EU] (February 6, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures [Model SLES-51927]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [US] (November 6, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [US] (November 6, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins [Model BLUS-31083]"[CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [EU] (November 15, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [EU] (November 15, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins [Model BLES-01768]"[CR]* Computers : [CR]PC [MS Windows 3.1/DOS, CD-ROM] [US] (1995) "Williams Arcade Classics" [CR]PC [MS Windows 95/DOS, CD-ROM] [US] (1996) "Williams Arcade Classics" [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [US] (August 27, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures" [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [EU] (November 23, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures"[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Buck Rogers - Planet of Zoom  (c) 1982 Sega.[CR]Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom is a forward-scrolling rail shooter where the user controls a spaceship in a behind-the-back third-person perspective that must destroy enemy ships and avoid obstacles. The game was notable for its fast pseudo 3-D scaling and detailed sprites. The game would later go on to influence the 1985 Sega hit Space Harrier. Buck is never seen in the game, except presumably in the illustration on the side of the arcade cabinet, and its only real connections to Buck Rogers are the use of the name and the outer space setting.

				<plot>Cloak &amp; Dagger (c) 1983 Atari.[CR]Agent X, complete with trenchcoat, Bogie hat, and briefcase, hurries through a series of adventures and misadventures to retrieve stolen plans and destroy dastardly Dr. Boom's subterranean bomb factory. Our masked hero descends to the depths of Dr. Boom's laboratory in a special elevator. On each floor he encounters a series of conveyor belts that are moving explosives. A giant bomb ticks down the game seconds while devices of Dr. Boom's plotting, such as bomb converters, forklifts deflecting shots back at Agent X, robot guards, acid pits, and crawling eyes shooting death rays, challenge the player(s).[CR]CLOAK &amp; DAGGER is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster video display. You control Agent X as he descends underground floor by floor in an elevator to Dr. Boom's lab, located on the 33rd floor. Your main goal is to retrieve Top Secret plans that are surrounded by an electrical arc. To stop the electrical current, Agent X must shoot all the fiery nodes as he fights off robot guards.[CR]As Agent X leaves the elevator on each floor, he must make his way carefully and quickly across the screen to another exit. Each floor displays a configuration of conveyor belts moving green unarmed and red armed explosives.  Agent X can pick up the green explosives. The red explosives will explode on contact. Some floors have marauding robot guards, death-ray shooting crawling eyes, and acid pits.[CR]Once Agent X has the top secret plans in hand, he must make his way back to the surface. If he exits on a floor that was bombed on the way down, he will find a massive crater protected by node monsters and the previously mentioned attackers. If he exits on a floor that was not bombed, a superguard will join the other attackers to challenge Agent X. On the final level, rumors are that he will meet the notorious Dr. Boom himself.[CR]At the center of the display, a double-coiled fuse to a giant bomb is ticking down the game seconds for each level. Agent X can light the fuse in a rush for bonus points, but must be able to escape that level before the bomb explodes. If the fuse has shortened on its own to one coil, it lights automatically and prompts Agent X to make a mad dash to the waiting elevator. The doors close just as a burst of light from the explosion is seen. The game's perspective now changes to a full view inside the elevator. Messages flash across the elevator to give helpful hints on the next level.[CR]Dr. Boom has placed explosive mines on every 4th floor. On each of the preceding 3 floors Agent X can pick up a secret map box that will show him part of the safe path across the minefield on the next 4th floor.[CR]Agent X's first goal is to travel successfully from one elevator to the other; his second goal is to pick up a secret box to get a map of the minefield on levels 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, and 32; the third goal is to light the bomb fuse and escape before the explosion.[CR]As game play progresses, Agent X may find an extra-life box and a mystery box that give bonus points, double speed, half speed, and occasionally, an extra life. Extra bonus points are earned for picking up green unarmed explosives or for skipping floors.[CR]If Agent X succeeds in capturing the top secret plans, he must fight his way back up to the top level. The appearance of box compressors, crawling eyes, and other enemies are more random on the way up than on the way down. If Agent X makes it back to the surface, a free game will be awarded (depending on the settings of the option switches).[CR]The game ends when you use up your last life or successfully make it to the surface.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 136023[CR]Main CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 1 Mhz), MOS Technology 6502 (@ 1.25 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) POKEY (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 256 x 232 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 64[CR]Players : 1[CR]Control : Double 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in December 1983.[CR]A Cloak &amp; Dagger unit appears in the 1984 movie 'Cloak and Dagger'.[CR]This game was in development independently from the movie of the same name under the title "Agent X". When the game was about 70% completed and the movie was about 40% done, the movie producers and editors came to Atari to see if Atari had a game they could film as backdrop to the movie scenes which needed a 'Cloak &amp; Dagger like spy game'. Atari agreed to change the name of its game to 'Cloak &amp; Dagger' and they put a couple of tid-bits into their script which referred to 'Agent X' (Dabny Colman's character). The game actually arrived on the scene about 2 months before the movie was released. It was tested under the name 'Agent X' in it's initial field test (about 5 months before the movie was released), but was never produced as anything but 'Cloak &amp; Dagger'.

				<plot>Defender (c) 1980 Williams.[CR]Defender is a legendary sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up - the very first of its genre - in which the aim is to pilot a laser-firing spaceship and protect humanoids stranded on the planet's surface from swarms of alien abductors.[CR]A long-range scanner at the top of the screen shows the positions of both the humanoids and the attacking aliens. The ideal strategy is to shoot down the alien ships before they reach the humanoids. If a humanoid is captured, the alien abductor can still be destroyed, but the player must then catch the falling humanoid and return it to the safety of the planet's surface before it falls to its death.[CR]If an alien is allowed to carry its victim to the very top of the screen, the humanoid will mutate, becoming a permanent part of the alien that captured it. This new and deadly mutation will then immediately join in the alien attack.[CR]The challenge becomes more intense as action progresses. Fighter ships and their mines will soon join the abductors. There are also mother ships that must be destroyed; these are particularly difficult as a direct hit smashes the mother ship into a swarming mass of mini-ships that must also be wiped out. Throughout the entire mission, the player must act quickly or face possible destruction by the cosmic baiter, a fast and dangerous enemy.[CR]Players have two escape options to use as a last resort. The first is the 'smart bomb', which destroys all on-screen enemies. The second option is 'hyperspace', which randomly teleports the player's ship to another part of the level. This is highly risky as it may place the player's ship in a position more dangerous than the one it left.[CR]If all humanoids are successfully abducted, the planet will explode in a blinding flash and the waves remaining until the next planet is reached take place in outer space, and consist solely of destroying enemy waves.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Board Number : D75 (top), D71F (A) [CR]Prom Stickers : DF [CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : M6808 (@ 894.75 Khz) [CR]Sound Chips : DAC [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 2-way joystick (vertical) [CR]Buttons : 5 [CR]= &gt; THRUST, FIRE, REVERSE, SMART BOMB, HYPERSPACE[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]According to Defender development lead Eugene Jarvis: The game was shown at AMOA Chicago October 31, 1980 and released a week or two later in November 1980.[CR]Along with Namco's seminal "Pac-Man", Defender shares the title of 'Highest Grossing Video Game of All Time' and to date has earned more than one billion dollars. It's interesting to note that when the now-legendary shoot-em-up was first shown at a 1981 Chicago arcade machine trade show, it was deemed to be a flop due to its high level of difficulty. Arcade industry insiders confidently predicted that both Defender and "Pac-Man" would be commercial flops and that Namco's "Rally-X" would be the next major arcade success. [CR]Defender's attract mode for the game was programmed in just five hours. [CR]Defender was noted for both its superb sound and visual effects and, moreover, for its extremely demanding gameplay. This didn't, however, stop players from accumulating millions of points when playing the game. Just minutes after the opening of the AMOA - an arcade industry trade show - Eugene Jarvis and his team - Defender's creators - were burning new ROMs for the game's display due to the fact they plugged the first burn into the board BACKWARDS and fried them. Due to the intimidating controls, hardly anyone at the show played the game and there were even rumours circulating suggesting that both "Pac-Man" and Defender would flop and that Namco's "Rally-X" would be the next big hit. Not only did Defender have the highest number of controls (five buttons, in addition to a two-way joystick) but it was also the first video game to feature an artificial 'world', in that game events occurred OUTSIDE the on-screen viewing area presented to the player. [CR]Chris Hoffman holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 79,976,975 points on January 1, 1984. [CR]Bill Jones holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 543,950 points on August 15, 2008. [CR]Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Star Trek 1981", "Defence Command", "Defense Command", "Zero" (Jeutel), and "Tornado" (Jeutel). [CR]Defender inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Defender' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. [CR]A Defender unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Terms of Endearment', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'. [CR]The official video of the 1982 pop song "Herbergsvater", by Joachim Witt, begins by featuring a Defender unit and contains long scenes of Defender gameplay.[CR]A mini Defender unit appears in the 1983 music video 'Almost Over You' by Sheena Easton. [CR]MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1983: win the most points by using your Defender ships to protect Humanoids from waves of aliens. A set of chance cards will bring the different aliens (Bombers, Landers and Humanoids) into play. Movement is determined with a spinner. Players can move their defenders and aliens.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Defender ROM sets were distinguished by early and later editions. The early edition supported only upright cabinets. In 1981 Williams released a cocktail cabinet version which necessitated extra code to flip the video display and to support a second set of game controls. The editions had some minor differences in the game's attract mode : The early edition gave an erroneous point value of '100' for alien landers; this was corrected to '150' in the later edition. Also, the high score value for player PGD was '14185' in the early edition and '14285' in the later edition. [CR]Early edition ROM sets : [CR]* Defender (White Label) [CR]* Defender (Green Label) [CR]* Defender (Blue Label) [CR]Later edition ROM sets : [CR]* Defender (Red Label)[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Lander : 150 points.[CR]Mutant : 150 points.[CR]Baiter : 200 points.[CR]Bomber : 250 points.[CR]Pod : 1,000 points.[CR]Swarmer : 150 points.[CR]Completely destroying a pod with a smart bomb : 1,150, 1,300, 1,450, 1,600, 1,750, 1,900, or 2,050 points. [CR]* The chances that a bombed pod will score 1,150, 1,300, or 1,450 points are 1/256 each.[CR]Getting hit by an enemy bullet : 25 points.[CR]Saving a humanoid from a Lander : 500 points.[CR]Depositing a humanoid into the ground : 500 points.[CR]Humanoid landing into the ground safely on his own : 250 points.[CR]Bonus at the end of each wave : [CR]Wave 1 : Humanoids Left X 100.[CR]Wave 2 : Humanoids Left X 200.[CR]Wave 3 : Humanoids Left X 300.[CR]Wave 4 : Humanoids Left X 400.[CR]Wave 5 and above : Humanoids Left X 500.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* The enemies that initially appear in each wave are : [CR]Wave 1 : 15 Landers [CR]Wave 2 : 20 Landers, 3 Bombers, and 1 Pod [CR]Wave 3 : 20 Landers, 4 Bombers, and 3 Pods [CR]Waves 4 and up : 20 Landers, 5 Bombers, and 4 Pods [CR]* Avoid using hyperspace unless you are about to die. Fighting off attacks, regardless of the number of enemies, will make you a better Defender player. [CR]* Baiters can usually be overcome by hitting the reverse button twice quickly. They will fly past you and be in range for your fire power. Do NOT try to outrun them as baiters are faster than your ship. [CR]* Swarmers are easy to defeat. You can hit reverse as soon as they fly past you and fly behind them. They cannot shoot backwards so you can blast away at will. [CR]* Shooting a Pod will release between 1 and 7 Swarmers. The chances that it will try to release 1, 2, or 3 Swarmers is 1/256 for each. Also, the maximum number of Swarmers allowed in the game is 20. So, for example, if there are 18 Swarmers in the game and a Pod is hit, it can only release a maximum of 2 Swarmers. [CR]* At higher levels, you will need to play God and even sacrifice some Humanoids (by killing them yourself) to preserve the rest of the planet's population. The planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the Humanoids from a fate worst than death (mutation). Do not worry, these Humanoids reproduce quickly and overpopulation has always been a constant problem. The planet will be fully populated at the start of every fifth attack wave (configurable). [CR]* The International Date Line : there are reverse lines for Swarmers and Mutants (AKA the 'International Date Line'). If this line is between you and the type of enemy in question, they will travel the opposite direction around the planet to get you (i.e. they won't cross this line to get to you). If a Mutant, say, is following you and you cross the Mutant reverse line (to the left of the big mountain) it will suddenly reverse direction and go around the other way. The same is true for the Swarmer reverse line (located approximately where your ship starts each wave). This doesn't affect Swarmers that you are following behind. If you're on one side of the line and a Pod is on the other and you shoot it open, the Swarmers will fly away from you and you can get in behind them immediately. The best use of these lines is where there are lots of Swarmers and/or Mutants that you don't want to hassle with. You stay near the line and go back and forth over it to keep the enemy on the other side of the planet. This is especially useful in space and waves that get really hairy. [CR]* Freeze : you can freeze a Defender machine by picking up all ten Humanoids (on any wave, but Wave 1 is your greatest chance at success), stopping all forward motion of your ship, quieting the screen down (i.e. having no enemies moving around on it) and setting all the Humanoids straight down quickly. This seems to work better were the terrain is very close to the bottom of the screen. Everything will freeze, but you can still move your ship up and down. Thrusting will break the spell, so to speak. If you do pick a spot with shallow terrain, some Humanoids will go thru the bottom of the screen and appear suspended in mid-air near the top. This trick is good to use during marathon games when you've reached Wave 256 and need a breather. [CR]* Some top players begin each round by shooting all the Humanoids except for one, which they pick up. The planet is too large for you protect and you are sparing the Humanoids from mutation, a fate worse than death. This keeps Mutants from developing, but it also means that the planet explodes if you lose your last Humanoid. The planet is fully repopulated at the start of every fifth attack wave (configurable). This can be considered an advanced trick. [CR]* Due to a bug in the algorithm that computes extra lives, every scoring activity from 990,000 to 999,975 will earn one extra ship and one extra Smart Bomb. If the player suicides on something or gets shot, one ship is lost, but one ship and one smart bomb are awarded; the net effect on the number of ships is zero. Dying on hyperspace re-entry awards nothing, because this awards no points. For winning N ships from 990,000 to 999,975, the player will have to achieve N x 10000 points after passing 1,000,000 before the game's accounting balances, and ships are awarded properly at 10,000 point intervals again. For example, if a player earns 45 extra lives during this interval, he will have to score another 450,000 points before being awarded another extra life. The player gets to keep surplus ships and bombs and can have super long turns where he may bomb two to three times per wave to get out of dangerous situations. [CR]* The trick is this: If the player wins 100+ ships between 990,000 and 1,000,000, this causes the game to start awarding extra lives right away again after turning the score over to zero. If the player wins 100 ships, the machine will have to wait 1,000,000 points to begin awarding ships again. However, since 1,000,000 is equivalent to zero, it awards them immediately at 1,010,000. [CR]* It's possible on a real Defender machine to make the screen color inverted so that all the black space is white while you are playing. It will reset itself when you die and maybe when you use hyperspace. Smart bomb flashes are cool when it's reversed. The trick was to drop a credit in right when you die and the screen flashes white. Somehow the program gets distracted (non-masked interrupt on coin drop?) and the screen stays white. [CR]* Defender attack waves 'roll over' at Wave 100, which is displayed, after being completed, as Wave 0. The game keeps track of the actual number of waves, even though they are not shown properly. For example, the next wave will be counted as Wave 101, even though it shows being completed as Wave 1. The game will 'roll over' again at Wave 200, which is displayed, after being completed, as Wave 0 as well. [CR]The next 'roll over' occurs at Wave 256. Upon completion of Wave 255, the next wave is a 'blank' wave, in which no enemies appear, and the wave immediately ends after the player&#8217;s ship appears on screen. This level is counted and displayed as Wave 0, and the player is awarded a bonus of humanoids left X 0 points (the bonus for this wave is always 0 points). The next is Wave 1, and the game now plays just as if the player had started a new game, except the player gets to keep his score and all of his bonus ships and smart bombs.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Mr. Do's Wild Ride (c) 1984 Universal.[CR]Mr Do's third arcade outing is another platform game, following on from the superb "Mr. Do's Castle", released a year earlier. The synonymous Mr. Do! cherries are present and correct, but are not used in the same way as in other games in the series. In both "Mr Do!" and "Mr. Do's Castle", collecting all of the cherries available was a way of completing a level. In Wild Ride, however, collecting them merely changes the 'prize' awarded upon reaching the level's goal. This can be one or two letters from EXTRA, or other items which simply award bonus points. When Mr. Do reaches his goal, he waves a flag while the bonus counter is added to his score.[CR]The gameplay is similar to that of Nintendo's legendary "Donkey Kong", with Mr. Do starting each level at the bottom of the screen, trying to make his way to the exit at the very top. Mr. Do doesn't have either his Powerball or mallet in this game, but holding the ACTION button makes him run faster along the track. The trade-off of this is that his bonus points deplete much quicker. When all of the EXTRA letters are collected, the player is awarded with an extra life.[CR]Each of the game's six levels is set on a roller coaster, with each having its own theme, traps and pitfalls. Wild Ride doesn't feature the intermission screens that appear in previous Mr.Do games.[CR]The levels are :[CR]Level 1, Roller Coaster. [CR]Level 2, Pirate Ship. [CR]Level 3, Three Elevators.

They obviously decided, however, that the "Mr. Do!" name was no longer commercially strong enough to guarantee strong sales, and instead re-tooled the game as 'Kong Strikes Back' - dropping Nintendo's ubiquitous giant ape into the game and arming the player with bombs - which act in the same way as Mr. Do's powerball.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Sundae : 100 points.[CR]Cocktail : 200 points.[CR]Umbrella : 300 points.[CR]Sword : 400 points.[CR]Money bag : 500 points.[CR]Trophy : 600 points.[CR]EXTRA letter : 500 points.[CR]Diamond : 10000 points.[CR]Climbing a ladder above a roller coaster :[CR]1 coaster : 100 points[CR]2 coasters : 300 points[CR]3 coasters : 500 points[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Elevator Action (c) 1983 Taito.[CR]Agent 17 (code name 'Otto') is to secure the top secret documents from the security building. The enemy spies are in pursuit and their orders are to stop him at any cost. Having made it to the top of a 30 story building, Agent 17 has to make his way down to the basement to get to the getaway car and save the documents. Enemy spies are everywhere and the documents are hidden behind the red doors (bonus points awarded). He has to open the door and keep moving. If either of them shoots the lights out there will be a temporary blackout. If Otto finds himself on top of the elevator the player will not be able to control the elevator. If he gets caught in the elevator he is a sitting duck and cannot duck the bullets. By using the escalator he can reach the basement quicker. Otto can defeat his enemy by jump kicking or firing at them. Help Otto to grab all the documents and escape the spies.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Elevator Action was available in 2 different arcade formats, a cocktail table and an upright dedicated cabinet. Both versions used the same internal hardware though.[CR]* The upright version came in the standard 'Taito Classic' cabinet, which was the same one used for Jungle Hunt, Zoo Keeper, Alpine Ski, and many others. These cabinets normally did not have side art that advertised the name of the game, instead they had a painted design of lines and shapes, along with a Taito logo. Different titles had different designs and color schemes, although they have been known to ship games in the wrong cabinets. But lets get back on track here. Elevator Action should come in a brown cabinet with a Taito logo up near the top. The marquee shows a scene of Agent 17 waiting for an elevator while an enemy agent shoots at him. While the monitor bezel shows agents on either side, has game instructions at the bottom, and shows an elevator floor display at the top. This bezel artwork is silk screened on glass, and is prone to peeling, be very careful if you have to handle one of these. The control panel has a single 4-Way ball-top joystick mounted centrally, with jump and fire buttons located to either side.[CR]Internally the machine uses a 19 inches open frame monitor mounted horizontally, and a set of game boards that conform to the 'Taito Classic' wiring standard. Many other early Taito games (such as "Jungle Hunt" and "Bubble Bobble") will plug directly into this cabinet without modification.[CR]* The cocktail version came in a table similar in design to the one used for Space Invaders and Carnival. It was not decorated except for a pair of instruction cards underneath the glass. Most Japanese game makers purchased their tables from the same few manufacturers, and were quite likely to change the exact model of cocktail that they shipped in mid production. So assume any Elevator Action cocktail is original unless it is obviously converted from another title.[CR]Runs on the "Taito SJ System" hardware.[CR]Prom Stickers : BA3 / EA[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2 (FIRE, JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Elevator Action was released in July 1983.

After 10th level, you will get 10,000 points per level completed.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, a quick animation will show a hook with a line connecting to the top of the elevator. Then your character will slide down the line to the roof. Then he will enter the building, in the elevator, at the 30th floor. It is now up to you to get all the secrets and make it to your car. The first thing you must know, obviously, is how to eliminate the enemy agents that are after you. There are a few ways you can do this :[CR]1) Just shoot them. Of course, especially in the later levels, enemy agents make themselves an impossible target by lying down. You can only take them out by riding an elevator down.[CR]2) Jumping on them will take care of them. In addition, you may avoid some of their fire.[CR]3) On the non-dark floors, shoot the light down on top of an enemy agent. You must do this from the elevator. This also has the added effect of causing temporary darkness in the building, making enemy agents harder to see.[CR]4) Crush an enemy agent using the elevator. This is hard to do since they move around. You may get lucky, however, and get one under or on top of the elevator you are on.[CR]5) This way is pretty hard. You might be able to get an enemy agent to follow you and fall down the hole created by the missing elevator.[CR]* You must know how to use the escalators and open the red doors :[CR]1) To use the escalators, just stand on the little rectangle. Then push the joystick UP or DOWN depending on which direction you need the escalator to take you.[CR]2) To open the red doors, stand on the little rectangle. Face the doorknob and press RIGHT on the joystick.[CR]* You have full control over any elevator you enter. This means you can move UP and DOWN on a dime to keep your character safe. This works until the alarm goes off.[CR]* Speaking of elevators, your character cannot duck while in an elevator. Also, while riding the escalators, your character cannot duck, jump, or fire his weapon.[CR]* Also on elevators, you do not have control when you are riding on top of them. This means you are at the mercy of the elevator or the enemy agent controlling it. Be very careful if you ride on top of the elevator. You also cannot go past the bar on the top of the elevator.[CR]* Enemy agents usually come out of the doors on the current floor or the floor above and below. A lot of times it is good to lay a wall of fire down a hallway. This way, you can pick off any enemy agents that happen to come out of one of the doors.[CR]* When you enter through one of the red doors, the enemy agents will lose track of your character but will have a general idea of where your character is. When you exit the room, crouch and lay down fire both left and right to clear off the floor.[CR]* As the levels progress, the enemy agents get better at their tactics. They start to crouch more to mess up your fire. They also may lay down which makes it impossible to hit them unless you are on an elevator and can shoot along the floor.[CR]* As you move up in levels, there will be red doors in odd areas. Areas such as on the lower five floors where only elevators can take you across. Of course, if you get good with the jump button, you can jump those gaps to get to either side quicker. The downside is that enemy agents will usually flood the area and lay down a lot of fire.[CR]* If you happen to get to the B1 floor and you have forgotten to get a red door, the game will automatically put your agent at the door you missed. If it is multiple doors, then you will be placed at the highest floor first.[CR]* There is an internal time limit on how long you can take to get everything out of the building. If you take too much time, an alarm sounds and the following things occur :[CR]a) Although you still have control over the elevators, it is much harder to get them to respond to your commands. If you are in a tight situation that requires a little bit of time, don't wait till the last minute or you may be an ex-agent.[CR]b) The enemy agents move much quicker and their shots move faster. Plus, additional enemy agents will start appearing to really make your life miserable.[CR]c) If your character happens to die, the next man will still be facing the same alarm situation. The only way to resolve the situation is to get all of the secrets and make it out of the building.[CR]* Watch out for the double elevator. If you are in the top car, it will stop two floors short of the bottom since there is a one floor gap, and the bottom car. Try to always get into the bottom car of a double elevator so that you can make a hasty exit and not be trapped with enemy agents firing on you.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Gauntlet (c) 1985 Atari Games.[CR]Gauntlet is a maze-based shoot-em-up for up to four players. Heavily influenced by classic fantasy conventions, players take on the role of either Thor the Warrior, Thyra the Valkyrie, Merlin the Wizard, or Questor the Elf and must play cooperatively as they explore and fight their way through the enemy-packed mazes. Competitive play is encouraged as players must fight for the limited amount of food, treasure, magic potions and power-up items that litter the dungeons. [CR]Each of Gauntlet's four characters have different strengths and weaknesses: Thyra has the strongest armour, Thor is best at hand-to-hand combat, Questor has the fastest speed and Merlin has the most powerful magic attacks. The object of the game is simply to survive as long as possible while exploring Gauntlet's mazes in search of treasure, food, magic potions and, ultimately, the exit that leads to the next dungeon. [CR]The potions - shown as blue bottles - that litter the levels offer either improved character abilities (such as 'speed' or 'extra shot power') or can be used as a 'smart bomb', destroying some or all of the on-screen monsters. Potions are also the only way to kill the game's 'Death' character that appears in many of the stages. Magic potions can be kept and used at the player's discretion by pressing 'Magic' button, although each potion can only be used once. [CR]The first seven mazes are always the same, but from level 8 onwards, players will find themselves on any one of over a hundred different mazes. If players survive for long enough, the mazes will be repeated in a different order. How long a player lasts depends upon the player's 'health' level. Health continually depletes as time progresses and further health is lost by contact with various monsters or their projectiles. Health can be replenished by consuming the food found in the mazes or by inserting more credits. The many treasure chests that litter the levels can be plundered for points, and collecting treasure increases a player's score multiplier when two or more players are playing the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 136037[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68010 (@ 7.15909 Mhz), MOS Technology 6502 (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), POKEY (Pot Keyboard Integrated Circuit) (@ 1.789772 Mhz), Texas Instruments TMS5220 (@ 650.826 Khz)[CR]Control per player (4): 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons per player (4): 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Gauntlet was released in October 1985.[CR]Gauntlet was originally going to be called 'Dungeons' and was inspired not only by TSR's tabletop RPG, 'Dungeons &amp; Dragons', but also by another Atari game called 'Dandy'. Dandy's creator, Jack Palevich, tried fruitlessly to get his name added to the list of credits in Gauntlet. In lieu of public recognition, Atari Games Corp gave Pelvich a Gauntlet cabinet, and he in turn agreed not to sue Atari.[CR]Two character names were changed before release. The Valkyrie was originally named 'Amazon' and the Warrior was 'Hulk'" The first character art was produced on January 1, 1984.[CR]Gauntlet's revolutionary, non-linear game-play gave players multiple choices, as they were no longer forced into taking a linear route through the game. Like 'Dungeons &amp; Dragons', Gauntlet players could choose their own path, searching for keys, treasures, food and transporters to take them to other levels. Unlike most other games at the time, the player didn't always have to fight; a simpler route through the dungeon could sometimes be found, or players could simply try to make a run for it.[CR]In the early '80s, arcades were struggling. Manufacturers created more elaborate games that operators could charge more money for ($.50!), but players were resistant to the increase. The question at Atari was: How do we get extra earnings? The idea with Gauntlet was that with four players you earn four times as much with every play. It was a drop-in/drop-out design so if someone died they could immediately rejoin or someone new could step in -- there was no down time, so the quarters just kept coming. Another choice made specifically to increase the coin drop: there was no end to the game. Gauntlet would recycle levels by flipping them horizontally and vertically once the players had run through all of them. Gauntlet was a big success in 1985. But the marketing team at Atari was actually worried about the four-player cabinet. They weren't sure four strangers would want to play a game together and they also had concerns about the four separate coin shoots (which were known to break easily). Confident in his game, Ed Logg convinced the marketing team to just go with it.[CR]Another Gauntlet milestone was in the game's use of sound effects. Synthesized human voices had been used sporadically in games in the early eighties and while it had proved, on most occasions, to be moderately successful, was still considered something of a novelty. Gauntlet, however, revolutionized the concept of in-game speech and added immeasurably to the game's superb atmosphere. The deep timbre of Gauntlet's very own 'Dungeon Master' would guide players through the levels, informing them that 'Elf needs food, badly', or that 'Wizard is about to die' and the always-good advice that is 'Remember, don't shoot food.'[CR]Note: The game contains exactly 212 sounds (including digitized voices, effects and musics).[CR]It was common practice to test a new arcade game at select locations before wide release. The operator was given the cabinet for free, but in exchange they couldn't promote it (as a precaution against competition) and they would share the coin drop numbers of it and all the other machines at the location so that Atari could evaluate the new game's success against current games. But when Ed Logg came by to check on Gauntlet during its field test, he found developers from SEGA snapping photos of the cabinet. Atari pulled it from that location and didn't work with the operator henceforth. A year after Gauntlet's release in 1985, SEGA released a four-player arcade game called "Quartet" (although it was side-scrolling). [CR]7,848 units were sold in the U.S. A few thousand more were sold in Japan and Europe. Even though Atari considered Gauntlet a success, earlier games like "Space Invaders" and "Ms. Pac-Man" sold hundreds of thousands of cabinets. One of Gauntlet's contemporaries from Atari, the excellent Temple of Doom game, sold just 2,800 copies. [CR]Note : There were 20 officially released versions (see Updates section for detailed info), including 6 '2-player' versions and various Spanish, German and Japanese versions. Counting 4-player English variants alone, there were 7 releases with various bug-fixes.[CR]The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including GAUNTLET.[CR]Charles Nagle holds the official record for this game with 4,401,169 points on March 28, 2003.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (That's Atari Music Vol.II : G.S.M. Atari Games 2 - PCCB-00070) on September 21, 1991.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1 (4-players)[CR]* First world release.[CR]Revision 2 (4-players)[CR]* Added an option called 'Disable Speech?' in the operator menu.[CR]* Fixed some texts in attract mode.[CR]Revision 3 (4-players)[CR]* German release only.[CR]Revision 4 (4-players)[CR]* World release.[CR]Revision 5 (4-players)[CR]* World release.[CR]Revision 6 (4-players)[CR]* German release only.[CR]* Added 'All walls turn into exits' trick (see 'Tips And Tricks' section).[CR]* Added ability to stop the attract mode with the fire button.[CR]Revision 7 (4-players)[CR]* World release.[CR]Revision 8 (4-players)[CR]* German release only.[CR]* Added an option called 'Reduce Text?' in the operator menu.[CR]Revision 9 (4-players)[CR]* World release.[CR]Revision 10 (4-players)[CR]* German release only.[CR]Revision 12 (4-players)[CR]* Japanese release only.[CR]Revision 13 (4-players)[CR]* Japanese release only.[CR]Revision 14 (4-players)[CR]* World release.[CR]* Sequence of boards may be different : After Level 8, either every other level may be skipped (Level 9 = Level 10, Level 10 = Level 12, etc.), or every two levels may be skipped (Level 9 = Level 11, Level 10 = Level 14, etc.), or boards may be played in their normal order.

Allow the players with the best fighting ability and armor (usually Thyra the Valkyrie and Thor the Warrior) to lead the way and fend off attacks.[CR]5) Avoid contact with the ghosts : they take away your health very quickly and you cannot fight them hand-to-hand.[CR]* If you remain motionless (or basically aimless) and stall off about 30 health, all of the doors will open. Everybody knows this, and the game even tells you about it. The game doesn't tell you that if you stall off about 200 health, all the walls will turn into exits! (work on Revision 6 and +) The game designers had to include this because there are some levels which require you to pick up a key before you exit. If you are already filled up with keys, and the doors are all gone, then it would be IMPOSSIBLE for you to exit, and you would starve to death. What they didn't anticipate, is that certain levels of the game which are really difficult, which would require you to take massive health losses to finish, become very simple if all the walls are exits. Or they can be effectively skipped altogether. Because the game has Monty-Hall levels with lots of food on them, you can use this cheat to only play levels which are a wash or increase your health dramatically, and cut your losses to 200 on all the really hard levels.[CR]* The best character to play, in the LONG run, is Questor. His magic is just as good as Merlin's and his fight ability as good as Thor's. His ability to shoot through cracks in addition to all this (when he has the power potions) makes him the best. Thyra is the worst, although some people regard this as a challenge...[CR]* To manipulate the point value of Death, shoot him. Death's point value takes the following progression : 1000-2000-1000-4000-1000-6000-1000-8000, and then back to start. His value keeps from the previous game.[CR]* You can kill Death painlessly by teleporting on top of him.[CR]* If a previous game ended beyond Level 8, Level 8 in the next game becomes the level that the previous game ended on. If you got a really good sequence of boards in a game and you want to repeat them, turn the machine off and on again after you've entered your high score.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Joust (c) 1982 Williams.[CR]Joust is a platform-based action combat game for one or two-players (with the two-player game offering either team-up OR head-to-head combat; the first time arcade gamers were given this choice) in which each player controls a knight riding on the back of a flying ostrich. [CR]The object of the game is to progress through platform-based levels by defeating groups of buzzard-riding enemy knights. This is achieved by 'jousting'; both enemy and player knights carry a lance and must fly around the level (actioned by repeatedly hitting the 'Flap' button) trying to oust rival knights from their steeds by ramming them with the lance. This can only be achieved if the attacking rider is above the enemy knight when the lance connects. A collision of equal elevations results in the two knights bouncing off each other, but if a player is lower than their enemy at the instant of contact, they themselves will be knocked from their steed and lose a life. [CR]A defeated enemy will turn into an egg that falls to the bottom of the screen. This must be quickly collected by players as if the egg lands on a platform and isn't retrieved in time, it will eventually hatch into another enemy knight that must be defeated again. [CR]Joust features three different types of enemy knights - Bounder, Hunter, and Shadow Lord - with each earning players different points values when defeated. A pterodactyl will appear after a predetermined time to hunt the players. [CR]Accurately navigating the player Knights can be initially quite difficult as control is strongly affected by both gravity and inertia. Players can lose a life by either being knocked from their steed by an enemy knight, or by falling into the lava pit at the bottom of each level.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]* The upright version of Joust was a dedicated cabinet. It is similar in shape to other Williams games from that era, but it is not identical to them. The cabinet is largely black with no painted art on the front of the machine. But it does have sideart, in this case a four-color painted rendering of a knight riding a large bird, while carrying a lance. This design is fairly simple when compared to the sideart on other games, and can be repainted by hand, as long as you are careful. The control panel, monitor bezel, and marquee are all filled with the expected graphics. The marquee especially is a stunning rendition of the Joust logo, and two riders inside the Joust world. Your Joust machine will come with either 2-way leaf switch joysticks, or 2-way optical ones. The early cabinets had the optical ones, while the later ones used the leaf stick ones. [CR]* The cocktail version (a cocktail game is a sit down table version), is notable because it was one of the most popular cocktail cabinets for conversion to newer titles. You see most cocktail tables originally held games that had monitors in a vertical orientation, and had a set of player controls on each end of the table. By 1985 no one was really making many vertical games, especially not ones that were one player at a time, and could flip the screen for the second player. But the Joust table was different. It had a horizontal monitor, and the players sat side by side, instead of at opposite ends of the table. This allowed the Joust cocktail cabinet to be used for all sorts of newer games. Electronically the cocktail version of Joust was identical to the upright version. The cocktail cabinet did not feature a lot of art, and was mostly black.[CR]The Joust PCBs are functionally identical to those used in "Defender", "Robotron - 2084", "Bubbles", "Sinistar", and "Stargate", only the ROM chips are different.[CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : M6808 (@ 894.75 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : DAC[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-way joystick (LEFT and RIGHT)[CR]Buttons : 1 (FLAP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Joust was released in September 1982. [CR]The name of this game is a reference for 'Jousting'. Jousting is a competition between two knights on horse-back, wherein each knight tries to knock the other off his mount. Jousting was popular in medieval times. [CR]Joust shares some sounds from "Defender" and "Stargate". [CR]James Vollandt holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 107,216,700 points. [CR]Don Morlan holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 1,002,500 points. [CR]A Joust unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'. [CR]A Joust unit appears (multiple times) in a 'Columbo' tv movie episode : (Murder, Smoke and Shadows) directed by James Frawley.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Red version has a default high score of 107,212 points, Green and Yellow versions have 109,102 points as the default high score. Also, the Green version fixes a well known bug that allowed you to endlessly kill Pterodactyls on certain levels, thus achieving incredible scores.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Killing enemies : [CR]Bounder (Red) : 500 points. [CR]Hunter (Silver/Gray) : 750 points. [CR]Shadow Lord (Blue) : 1,000 points. [CR]Pterodactyl : 1,000 points. [CR]Getting killed : 50 points. [CR]Picking up eggs or hatchlings : 250, 500, 750, or 1,000 points (progressive). The progression starts again when the player is killed or starts the next wave. [CR]Picking up an egg before it touches the ground : 500 points. [CR]Not dying during a Survival Wave : 3,000 points. [CR]If neither player kills the other during a Team Wave (2-player game only) : 3,000 points for each player. [CR]The first player who kills the other player during a Gladiator Wave (2-player game only) : 3,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your man will be at the entry point at the bottom of the playing field. From the other entry points, enemy riders will appear. It will then be up to you to successfully defeat them. Learning to flap your ostrich's wings is the most vital aspect of this game. How fast or slow you flap the wings determines speed and maneuverability. Once you get good, you will be able to glide around and only flap for either altitude or to hit an enemy rider.[CR]* The name of the game is height. Whoever is the higher rider during a joust is the winner. If you and an enemy collide on the same level, the impact will knock you both backwards a little and turn you both around. This can prove to be dangerous if more then one enemy is coming for you since the first one turns you around and the second knocks you off your mount.[CR]* You need to pay particular attention to the screen setup on each wave. Different platforms may collapse forcing you to readjust your strategy accordingly. Using the 20-wave example from Chapter 6.4, I will give you some basic strategies...[CR]a) During the non-pterodactyl waves and platform one is intact, your best bet is to hang out under the right side of platform one. The enemy riders have to drop to get to you.  Just a quick press of the flap button should give you altitude over them and the easy kill.[CR]b) If you lose platform one, the next best place is platform five. This forces the enemy riders to rise up to you. If you hover over the left or right edge, you can drop on enemy riders trying to rise up from the areas of platforms two and three. Of course, if any make it to your level, just sit on that entry point. When an enemy rider gets near, rapidly climb and move over toward the enemy to knock them off their mount.[CR]c) When you only have platforms two and three, you will use a modified strategy from the one above. You will hover around the area that platform five was at. This forces the enemy riders to rise up to you, thereby exposing themselves to you dropping down on them.[CR]d) If any of the above have Shadow Lords in them, you will have to be prepared to move around quickly since Shadow Lords are very fast and they tend to bounce off the top of the game screen.[CR]* There are a couple of ways to kill off the pterodactyl during the pterodactyl waves :[CR]1) First of all, you must be facing the pterodactyl in order to kill it.[CR]2) If platform one still exists, then just wait for the pterodactyl and be ready for it to choke itself on your lance. If there are multiple pterodactyls, they usually come from opposite sides so the first one will have you turned around to meet the second one.[CR]3) If platform one is gone, they use platform two to do your prehistoric hunting. If there are multiple pterodactyls, then you will have to move around until the second and subsequent pterodactyls are coming at your rider head on while you sit atop platform two.[CR]4) If you are real good, you can kill the pterodactyls off in the air. You just have to make sure that your lance is evenly aligned with the pterodactyls mouth.[CR]5) Pterodactyls also show up if you take too long on a wave. These can't be killed using the platform method. The only way is either in the air or to lose a man.[CR]6) Some players take out all the enemy riders but one. Then they lead this rider toward the lave so the Lava Troll can grab them. The player then sits and hunts pterodactyls. This is a long process that is definitely loaded with peril.[CR]7) If you get killed before killing the pterodactyl, it is very hard to get in position to kill the pterodactyl since it does involve a sort of rhythm. Also keep in mind that the enemy riders will still be trying to dismount you as you are hunting.[CR]* The Pterodactyl Trick : Classic trick! Doesn't work on upgraded Joust machines, or on "Joust 2". Trick the last jouster on the stage to fly to the lava and get trapped by the lava troll. Then wait in the center of the middle platform. When a pterodactyl comes out, it'll fly right into your lance. The next part takes a fair amount of practice : When the pterodactyl has hit you, your character will be knocked back. Jiggle the joystick so that your mount is back in the middle of the ledge again. Keep doing this. Eventually there'll be a steady stream of pterodactyls and you'll be killing 'em about two per second, for 1,000 points each. When you make a mistake and get killed, the trapped jouster will escape. On the last board in which this works (47), the jouster will not escape.[CR]* The Lava Troll hazard isn't too major unless you fly too close to the surface of the lava. If you do happen to get grabbed, flap rapidly to escape.  It is also easy to hit enemies immobilized by the troll.[CR]* After you hit an enemy rider, they become an egg. After a few seconds, the egg will hatch to the next hardest enemy rider. For example, a Bounder becomes a Hunter; a Hunter becomes a Shadow Lord. After that, it will always be a Shadow Lord. Some players leave one egg and then hover over it. When the enemy buzzard comes to pick up the rider, you knock him off the saddle again and collect the points. Again, the pterodactyl will show up soon to end this fun.[CR]* Make sure you don't knock too many enemy riders off at once or there will be eggs scattered all over the place. This makes it hard to keep the enemy population down to a dull roar.[CR]* Whenever your rider gets killed, he will appear at the entrance point all shimmery. If you let the sequence go, it will take up to five seconds for your rider to appear. During that time, he is immune to all attacks. Your rider will enter at the point there is the least amount of enemies. This is usually the very bottom platform. Keep in mind, the enemies also enter at these points.[CR]* The game does reach a point where there are so many enemy riders running around, they are constantly bumping into one another. This, in effect, creates a wall which is very difficult and hazardous to navigate through. This means you have to split up the enemy[CR]* If you die during a wave, try quickly to get your bearings so that you can get in position to continue depleting the enemy forces.[CR]* The above tips are as valid for the two-player game as they are for the one-player game. In the two-player game, though, you and the other player can cover each other to make it more difficult for the enemy to knock you off your mounts.[CR]* Phantom Energizer : In a two-player game (on a screen just before the middle ledge disappears) clear all opponents except one. Kill him, leaving the egg in the middle of the bottom platform. Player 1 stands on the bottom energizer while player 2 jumps in the lava. If player 2 appears on the top energizer, then the trick will work. Player 1 then gets the egg. The 'phantom' ledge should remain.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Joust (1982)[CR]2.

				<plot>Jungle King (c) 1982 Taito.[CR]Jungle King is a jungle adventure game where players take on the role of Jungle King, a Tarzan-like jungle man, who is going in search of his Jungle Princess, who has been kidnapped by a pair of barbaric cannibals. [CR]Jungle King has four stages, each with its own unique scenarios, so each stage could be considered a separate game in its own right. [CR]It is noticable that this game scrolls from right to left, while the vast majority of scrollers go from left to right, although most people probably wouldn't even notice that. [CR]Jungle King's gameplay is very similar to that of Activision's "Pitfall", a classic arcade game released on many home computer and console formats of the time. [CR]The game's stages are as follows : [CR]* The first stage, which may have been the best stage in the game, is set in a forest with a series of swinging vines. Players must use the JUMP button to move from right to left across the vines, while avoiding the monkeys that can send Jungle King falling to the ground. This level is easy to master, but players must time their jumps carefully to make it to the next vine. [CR]* The second stage is set under a jungle river. Players must guide Jungle King through a river infestest with alligators and crocodiles. This stage features a 'breath meter' that must be carefully watched to avoid drowning (players simply swim up to the surface to get more air). Jungle King is armed with a knife with which he can stab the crocs and gators, but this can only be done when their mouths are not fully open. [CR]* The third stage is an avalanche with boulders rolling down a hill. The player simply uses the joystick to control Jungle King's climbing speed up the hill, and the JUMP button to leap over rolling boulders until they reach the end of the stage. [CR]* The fourth and final stage has the player guiding Jungle King through a cannibal village. Jungle King must jump over the cannibals while their spears are down, and eventually make his way towards his Jungle Princess, who is being lowered into a pot to be boiled for supper. [CR]On completion of the game, players are rewarded with a short 'I Love You' ending, and then the game begins again with increased difficulty.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Jungle King used the familiar 'Taito Classic' cabinet that was used for a variety of early 1980's games. This was a rather short cabinet, and had a monitor that was laid back at more than a 45 degree angle. Most of these cabinets featured the same painted sideart which consisted of an ornate border and a 'Taito' logo. Many other early Taito games will plug right into the machine without modification (although the boardsets for these early games tend to be expensive). The marquee to this title showed a 'Jungle King' logo, with the hero to the right of it and a (rather slutty looking) blond woman tied to a tree on the left hand side. Jungle greenery filled the rest of the marquee's surface area. The monitor bezel was decorated with a red and orange design, while the control panel overlay had a cartoony jungle scene on it. [CR]Runs on the "Taito SJ System" hardware.[CR]Prom Stickers: KN[CR]Players: 2 [CR]Control: 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons: 1 (JUMP/KNIFE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in August 1982, this is how "Jungle Hunt" started life. [CR]Jungle King was the first 'side-scrolling, jumping &amp; attacking game with a humanoid character', appearing in arcades three years before Miyamoto's classic "Super Mario Bros.".[CR]This was also the first video game ever to feature a Tarzan look-alike as a playable character. But, Taito never bothered to get permission from the estate of Edgar Rice Burroughs, so they were sued for copyright infringement for using Tarzan's likeness. So this title quickly went out of production, and is rather rare today. They later reworked the graphics, and the game reappeared in October 1982 as Jungle Hunt. Please see the Taito America "Jungle Hunt" entry for a list of the cosmetic changes made to the game. [CR]A prototype of this game is known as "Jungle Boy". [CR]A reworked version of this game is known as "Pirate Pete". [CR]This game was released in Brazil in 1983 under the "Jungle Hunt" moniker, but none of the other post-lawsuit changes made for the Taito America version were implemented. [CR]A Jungle King unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]A version of Jungle King is known to exist with alternate sound.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Successfully jumping between vines : 100 points [CR]Stabbing Crocodiles and Alligators : 100 points [CR]- with open jaws : +100 points[CR]- in deep water : +100 points [CR]Jumping over a rock : 200 points [CR]Ducking under a rock : 100 points[CR]Running under a rock : 50 points [CR]Jumping over a cannibal : 100 points [CR]Finishing stages 1-3 : 500 points [CR]Finishing stage 4 (jump into and rescue woman) : timer bonus[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Forest : [CR]1) The main thing to remember on this stage is timing. Some vines swing faster then others. As you go farther into the game, the vines will really start to swing fast so you must be able to time your jumps accordingly. [CR]2) The best place to catch a vine is in the middle or lower (ideally the bottom of the vine is the best). This way, you give yourself enough jumping room to get to the next vine. [CR]3) Don't just start jumping to the vines without looking. If a vine is moving away from you, wait until it's halfway to you, then jump. [CR]4) At the later levels, monkeys will appear on the vines. If you hit a monkey while trying to leap for a vine, the monkey will knock you down to the ground. [CR]5) After the fourth level, your jumps will become slower. You will need to start your jump before the vine you are on reaches its maximum forward swing position. This will give you a small boost in jumping power. [CR]* River : [CR]1) On this stage, you will be swimming through a jungle river. Things to remember are to keep track of your Diving Display. If the bar goes all the way to the left, your man will become a floater. Swim up to the surface every now and then for a breath of air. [CR]2) The biggest hazards are the crocodiles and alligators. Fortunately, you have your trusty knife with you. In order to kill a croc or gator, their mouths have to be closed. If they aren't, you will become free food. Also, if you collide with any part of a croc or a gator, you will die. Extra points are awarded if you stab them when their mouths are partially open, or if they are deep in the water. There are two types of alligators distinguishable by their "teeth". Small-toothed alligators act normal. Big-toothed alligators, however, are faster, will try to follow you, and will move up and down very quickly. [CR]3) Another hazard is the air bubbles. If you happen to swim into them, they will push you immediately to the surface regardless of what hazards may be in your way. The best way to work around this is to vary your speed by moving the joystick left and right and time it so that there are no hazards above the air bubbles. [CR]* Avalanche : This is probably the easiest screen.[CR]1) The main obstacle here are large and small boulders which you must dodge in some way. The small boulders can be avoided by jumping over them, but to dodge the large ones, you may either jump, run, or duck by pulling down on the joystick.[CR]2) Moving the joystick left or right controls your speed up the hill. If you hold the joystick left or right, your character will jump at mid-level. If you hold the joystick in an up-left or up-right position, he will jump at his peak level. Try to judge whether a boulder is going to be high or low by the time it reaches your current position. If it's going to be in mid-air, and you find it unsafe to jump or duck, just move to a safer position as quickly as possible. [CR]3) In later levels, the larger boulders are seen more frequently, and small boulders fall down the mountain in groups. [CR]* Cannibals : Probably the hardest screen because you have to time your jumps in between the two cannibals... [CR]1) Get right next to the first cannibal. Keep in mind, you can only jump when their spears aren't in the air or you will be skewered. [CR]2) Also, watch the vine that Jungle Princess is tied to. It is going up and down, so you have to time your jumps for both the cannibals and your woman. [CR]3) The cannibals wander back and forth at slightly different rates. Because of this, they get close together, then spread out again. [CR]4) You have to jump between the cannibals, then jump up when Jungle Princess is at the lowest point on the vine. This will require timing and there is no pattern or trick. Just keep in mind that if you can't get to her, jump back to your original position or the second cannibal will get you. [CR]5) On the later levels, everything moves much quicker, and a third cannibal joins them up on the tree. He will shoot blow darts at you that you must move to avoid.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]Home conversions didn't start appearing until long after the aforementioned lawsuit by the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate against Taito was settled.

[CR]The Bungeling Empire, made famous in the Lode Runner series, is also the antagonist in "Vs. Raid On Bungeling Bay". Both games were developed by Broderbund Software. [CR]Here is the full story of the game from one of the makers : The person most responsible for the development of Lode Runner was Doug Smith. He and I both lived with our parents in Renton, Washington, and commuted to school at the University of Washington in Seattle. Doug attempted to get into the Computer Science Department twice before settling on a Physics major. Later, I was accepted to the Computer Science Department, but guess which one of us became a millionaire. Doug eventually dropped out of college in the wake of Lode Runner's success. [CR]The earliest version of Lode Runner was written in Fortran on the University's VAX 1. It was called 'Kong' because of its similarities to "Donkey Kong". Since developing video games was not authorized use of the University's resources, it was known as 'graph' until its completion. 'graph' would prompt the user for a function, then crap out unless the secret password was entered to play 'Kong'. The secret password became common knowledge among students, so a 'show process' command would often report 80% of the users running 'graph'. [CR]The only co-author of 'Kong' was James Bratsanos (or something like that, I never met him). He contributed about 15% of the total man hours to the development of the Fortran version and 0% to later versions. [CR]'Kong' worked on ASCII terminals. The bricks were solid block characters, the player was a dollar sign, and the bad guys were paragraph symbols. A paragraph symbol is basically a backwards capitol P with a double vertical line. Everyone thought they looked like cobras, and referred to them as snakes. The player bounced along rapidly and was hard to control. You had to hit the space bar to make him stop moving. [CR]The next version was called 'Miner'. It was developed in Doug's bedroom in 6502 Assembly Language on an Apple II+ borrowed from Mark Ledbury. It was also Mark who prodded Doug to finish the game. Doug originally wanted to keep the bad guys as snakes, slithering around the screen. The most notorious 'feature' of this version is the lack of inter-square animation. Doug had stolen the four frame running man sequence from Dan Gorlin's "Choplifter" game, but still moved the man by leaps and bounds around the screen. It looked like he was ice skating. [CR]Doug submitted 'Miner' to four video game marketing companies : Broderbund, Electronic Arts, Sirius Software and Epyx. Broderbund offered him an advance of $10000 and 23% royalties on gross sales. One of the others offered him $100000 flat. He made the right choice : Broderbund, of course. Doug blamed Sirius for leaking a copy of Miner which was widely distributed in southern California. [CR]Broderbund gave him the advance with no strings attached other than he couldn't market it elsewhere. To get the royalties, he would have to complete the game to their satisfaction. This included the addition of inter-square animation, sound effects, and a new title page for a new name : Lode Runner. He would also have to deliver on the 150 screens he had promised. [CR]With new incentive, Doug worked around the clock, dropping his classes for the quarter (Spring, 1983). He wasn't creative enough to think of 150 screens (he had about 30), so he let the neighborhood kids come over and design screens with the screen editor. He paid the kids on a per screen basis for every one that ended up in the final release. The game was ready by Summer of 1983. [CR]Broderbund had an ex Walt Disney animator working in-house. For a cut of the profits, he would design a nice title page. Doug took him up on his offer. An in-house programmer, Dane Bingham, provided the Commodore C64 conversion and perhaps others. Doug worked on the conversion for the Atari 800 conversion himself. I'm not sure if he finished it. A Japanese company even made a little known arcade version with horrible sound. Doug offered James Bratsanos a flat payment for his role in the development of the Fortran version. James was surprised to receive anything at all, and accepted. [CR]Doug's royalties started pouring in. He broke Dan Gorlin's Broderbund record of $77000 in one month royalties. The last I heard, he had grossed 2 million dollars in total royalties. Apparently, he didn't get very good tax advice, because he paid about half of it to the IRS. With his net profits, Doug bought at Porsche 911 Carrera, a Bayliner speedboat, a house in Issaquah, and a wife (as a colleague once joked). [CR]With the money going out so fast, Doug realized that he didn't have enough to retire on. He started his own company called QAD. It stood for Quick And Dirty, but he was prepared to say Quality And Diversity if he felt someone couldn't handle the real name. He and his two partners, Chip Bulkeley and Mark Ledbury soon began another project named Ralph. It was to be one of the first video games to utilize double-hires Apple II hardware. Mark just did the graphics. Chip ended up doing more work than Doug and insisted on renegotiating their split before proceeding. The project became more and more overdue and was eventually scrapped. Doug went back to making new and improved versions of Lode Runner, his bread and butter. I haven't heard from him since. [CR]Although Broderbund is now owned by Mattel Interactive, Mr. Smith still owns the rights to Lode Runner. [CR]Alberto Manenti, Emanuele Lubiani and Massimo Gaspari all hold the official record for this game with 999999 points. [CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (R*Type : Irem Game Music - 28XA-199) on January 25, 1988.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* If you finish a level in less than half of the time, the time bonus is multiplied by 2. [CR]* If you do not kill any enemy during a level, a 10000-point bonus is granted. [CR]* If you do not make any enemy fall in a hole during a level, a 20000 points bonus is granted! [CR]* If during a fall, you land on an enemy, you do not lose but obtain 1000 points. [CR]* Easter egg : there is a hidden monster from the next block on every level where digging is allowed (some levels have only stone, thus, the blaster cannot make holes). The monster can be uncovered by blasting the dirt that it is hiding in. Once it is uncovered, it will join in pursuing the player. If it is entrapped, it will leave behind a bonus of 3000 to 8000 points. Its entrapment will not count against the 20000 entrapment bonus.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Lode Runner (1983)[CR]2.

				<title_clean>Classics Horiz - Moon Patrol</title_clean>
				<plot>Moon Patrol (c) 1982 Irem.[CR]The player controls a moon buggy, viewing it from the side, that travels over the moon's surface. While driving it must avoid obstacles such as craters and mines. The buggy is also attacked by UFOs from above and tanks on the ground.[CR]- CAST OF CHARACTERS -[CR]PLAYER CHARACTER - MOON BUGGY : Your vehicle across the rugged lunar terrain is a specially designed moon buggy. It comes with six wheels on three specially mounted axles that contain especially absorbent shocks which allow the buggy to glide across the uneven landscape of the moon. The wheels of the buggy can be utilized to create short hops, which allow the buggy to jump over pits and other hazardous obstacles that can't be removed in time. It is also equipped with a roof mounted gun for anti-air fire and a forward mounted cannon. The anti-air gun can fire up to four bullets on the screen at one time, while the cannon can only project one bullet at a time. The buggy is destroyed by impact with an obstacle, getting hit by alien craft bombs, or falling into a lunar pit.[CR]ENEMIES ON THE GROUND :[CR]1) Craters and Rocks - Throughout the course of driving on the moon, you will encounter natural terrain obstacles that you must overcome. Nothing more can be done about craters than jumping over them. Most craters are spaced out, but a few come in rapid succession of one another, so jumps must be timed carefully. In addition to craters, you will come across rocks on the landscape. Most rocks are easily dispatched with one shot from your cannon. Sometimes, two rocks occur back to back. If you're fast enough, you can destroy them both. Otherwise, you may opt to jump over the pair. Small rocks lie below the height of your cannon fire. They can only be destroyed if the shot from your cannon detonates near the rock. Otherwise, the shot will sail harmlessly over the rock. When in doubt, jump over the rocks to be safe.[CR]2) Land Mines - These small objects which flash white and red make their first appearance after point J in the beginner course. Like pits, they can not be destroyed and must be jumped over. They tend to occur in rapid succession, so it is recommended that you travel no faster than regular speed until you are an expert player. When two mines are approximately two moon buggy lengths apart, it is important to jump over the first one considerably early so that you don't land on the second, and have enough time to jump off the ground before you reach it.[CR]3) Boulders - At certain points along your patrol, the elevation of the moon's surface rises. The first such occurrence is between points P and Q in the beginner course. While you are driving uphill, it is not uncommon to encounter boulders rolling down towards your buggy. Like rocks, these boulders can be rendered harmless with your cannon. Even the small boulders present little challenge thanks to the incline of the surface elevating them to the level of your cannon. But be prepared for a difficult jump if too many come at you at once and you don't have enough time to destroy them all.[CR]4) Tanks - These first appear after point U in the beginner course. They are stationary, and typically fire one bullet at a time in your direction. Their bullets and the shots from your cannon cancel each other out, so you must immediately fire again in order to hit the tank. Any delay on your part will result in the tank firing once more, preventing you from destroying the tank before you reach it. Tanks can be jumped over if necessary.[CR]5) Rocket Cars - The first of these appears after point A in the champion course. It will trail behind you until it is ready to strike. Stay fast, and don't do anything until it begins to approach you. When it is half-way between you and the edge of the screen, jump up and let it sail underneath you. Fire as soon as you land to destroy it for 500 points. [CR]6) Space Plants - A strange type of vegetation exists on the moon, favouring to make their homes in the craters of the lunar surface. They bob in and out of the craters in an effort to catch whatever they can grab. These space plants first appear shortly before point H in the champion course. A shot from the cannon is enough to render the space plant harmless, but the crater must still be leaped over. Attempting to leap over a crater that still contains a space plant can be a dangerous gamble if not timed perfectly.[CR]ENEMIES IN THE AIR[CR]Alien Craft : There are three types of craft that the enemy employs when trying to defeat you from overhead. They all appear in groups ranging from two to five.[CR]1) Regular Craft - These weave back and forth dropping bombs on the buggy. The bombs can be destroyed with your anti-air gun, but they make difficult targets. If this craft is left on the screen for too long in later levels, it may fly down to collide with your buggy.[CR]2) Elliptical craft - These behave nearly identical to the regular craft. They drop bombs on you with increasing accuracy. The long you remain at a particular speed, the better their shots will get, so make sure to mix your speed up in order to confuse them. Sometimes, you can jump at the last minute and avoid getting hit if the bomb is about to hit the back of your buggy.[CR]3) Tri-orb craft - This craft, made of three circles bound together, is the deadliest of them all. Rather than dropping normal bombs at the buggy, they pitch terrain deforming grenades at the path ahead of you. You must watch the trajectory of their small flashing grenades and anticipate when you might need to jump as a result of the newly formed pit left by their grenade's impact with the ground. Like the bombs, the grenades can be shot, but they are even harder to hit.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Irem M-52 hardware[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola M6803 (@ 894.886 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 894.886 Khz), (2x) MSM5205 (@ 384 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control: 2-way joystick (controls speed of moon buggy)[CR]Buttons: 2[CR]=&gt; [1] Fire, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Moon Patrol was released in June 1982 in Japan.[CR]Moon Patrol was one of the earliest linear side-scrolling shoot'em ups and the first game to feature parallax scrolling.[CR]Some graphical glitches :[CR]- Shoot an alien ship as it falls and it remains on the screen, with its point total.[CR]- Bombs dropped in pits explode on the surface.[CR]- Occasionally you'll miss an enemy you appear to hit, but it works the other way around, too.[CR]- Occasionally the enemy missiles will hit your very edge and nothing will happen. Don't get too used to this happening, though![CR]- When you jump but still fall in a pit, you always make it halfway between the edge before falling in.[CR]The attract mode course uses its own unique course of gameplay. The screen, however, says 'Beginner course' at the top when the moon buggy is parked at the moon base. The enemies encountered in attract mode are as follows :[CR](Moon base)[CR]Large (double) rock, Large crater, 2 space plants (the second space plant has a rock adjacent to it), Large crater, Small crater, 2 tanks[CR](Point A)[CR]Uphill climb with rolling boulders, Formation of 3 regular alien crafts, Formation of 3 tri-orb crafts[CR](Point B)[CR]Downhill descent with formation of 3 elliptical alien crafts[CR](Point C)[CR]Rocket car, Large crater and small crater adjacent to each other[CR](Unfortunately, the moon buggy always falls into the large crater that follows the rocket car, so technically the attract mode course ends there. Sometimes the alien craft between points A and C would defeat the moon buggy; other times the moon buggy would mistime its jump over the rocket car. The land mines do not appear in the attract mode).[CR]Mark Robichek holds the official record for this game with 1,214,600 points.[CR]A Moon Patrol unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid'.[CR]A Bootleg of this game is called "Moon Ranger".[CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (R*Type : Irem Game Music - 28XA-199) on January 25, 1988.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Regular alien craft :[CR]Destroying - 100 points[CR]Elliptical alien craft :[CR]Destroying - 100 points[CR]Tri-orb alien craft :[CR]Destroying - 200 points[CR]Alien craft formation bonus (for destroying all alien craft in a formation) :[CR]Formation of three - 500 points[CR]Formation of four - 800 points[CR]Formation of five - 1,000 points[CR](no bonus points for a formation of two) [CR]Small craters :[CR]Jumping over - 50 points[CR]Large craters :[CR]Jumping over - 100 points[CR]Small rocks :[CR]Jumping over - 50 points[CR]Destroying - 100 points[CR]Medium rocks :[CR]Jumping over - 80 points[CR]Destroying - 100 points[CR]Large (double) rocks :[CR]Jumping over - 100 points[CR]Half destroying - 100 points[CR]Half destroying and jumping over - 180 points[CR]Destroying - 200 points[CR]Land mines :[CR]Jumping over - 50 points[CR]Rolling boulders :[CR]Destroying - 50 points[CR]Jumping over - 100 points[CR]Tanks :[CR]Jumping over - 100 points[CR]Destroying - 200 points[CR](no points for shooting the tank's missile)[CR]Rocket cars :[CR]Destroying - 500/800/1,000 points depending on distance[CR](no points for jumping over rocket cars)[CR]Space plants :[CR]Jumping over - 100 points[CR]Destroying - 300/500/800 points depending on their height when destroyed + 100 points for jumping over the crater[CR]Reaching a checkpoint in under average time : [CR]Beginner course - 1,000 point bonus [CR]Champion course - 2,000 point bonus[CR]Reaching checkpoint 'Z' : [CR]Beginner course - 5,000 points[CR]Champion course - 10,000 points[CR]Time remaining at checkpoint - 100 points per second under average time[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Enemies that appear in later stages also appear in the attract mode. If you watch the attract mode carefully, you'll learn how to deal with these adversaries.[CR]Moon Patrol is primarily divided into 2 courses; the Beginner course and the Champion course. Each course is divided into 26 sections labelled A through Z. Each section is organized into 4 groups of 5 and 1 group of 6 at the very end. At the end of each group, your time is compared to the average time for potential bonus points.[CR]BEGINNER COURSE[CR]A - E[CR]In the very first stretch, you will encounter 3 small craters, and 2 rocks. Jump over all of the craters and fire your cannon at the rocks. [CR]Point A [CR]By the time you drive over point A, 2 of the first alien crafts will appear overhead. They will be joined by two of the elliptical crafts. A rock will appear towards the end. [CR]Point B [CR]2 more crafts appear while a rock approaches your buggy. A few more rocks and a crater will follow. [CR]Point C [CR]3 elliptical crafts will appear. Destroy them for a 500 point bonus while you jump over the 2 craters and destroy the rock. [CR]Point D [CR]2 tri-orbs will introduce themselves. Be careful of the craters that their grenades might make. They are quickly followed by 2 regular crafts. One rock and one crater precedes the end.[CR]F - J[CR]Point E [CR]The section begins with 2 tri-orbs followed by 2 elliptical crafts. A crater and rock appear towards the end. [CR]Point F [CR]More difficult obstacles appear, such as large craters, double rocks that must be fired on twice, and small rocks that must be hit by the explosion of the cannon shot. [CR]Point G [CR]2 craft appear while you jump over large craters and destroy a few rocks that get in your way. [CR]Point H [CR]There are simply 2 tri-orbs and 2 regular crafts in this section. [CR]Point I [CR]The first group of three tri-orbs will appear. Destroy them all for 500 points. Then a rapid succession of craters and rocks will occur, including double and small rocks. You may wish to slow down towards the end to deal with them all. [CR]K - O[CR]Point J [CR]This section introduces you to land mines, the small objects that flash white and red. Like craters, they can not be destroyed and must be jumped over. They tend to occur in rapid succession, so it is recommended that you travel no faster than regular speed until you are an expert player.[CR]Point K [CR]More land mines in this section. When 2 land mines are approximately 2 buggy lengths apart, it is important to jump over the first one considerably early so that you don't land on the second, and have enough time to jump off the ground before you reach it. [CR]Point L [CR]Many of the land mines you encounter here come in pairs, but they are no more difficult to jump at regular speed than single mines. [CR]Point M [CR]Space craft resume their attack and this time 4 of the regular type appear to attack. Destroy them all for an 800 point bonus. This is followed by 3 elliptical crafts, worth 500 bonus points if they are all destroyed. [CR]Point N [CR]4 tri-orbs appear, followed by 3 elliptical crafts. If you can destroy them all, you'll net a 1300 point bonus.[CR]P - T[CR]Point O [CR]A quad of tri-orbs start off this section, followed by 3 regular crafts. [CR]Point P [CR]This section is the first uphill climb that you encounter. Boulders of all three sizes will fall down the hill in no larger groups than pairs. Even the smallest boulders should be easy to shoot. [CR]Point Q [CR]4 elliptical craft appear. Be aware that their bombs don't need to travel as far in order to hit you. Also keep your eyes open for the large craters and double rock formations that show up. [CR]Point R [CR]As you begin to descend downhill, a pair of both regular space crafts will appear and bomb you from overhead. [CR]Point S [CR]3 regular crafts appear near simultaneously with 3 tri-orb craft. Stay alert to newly formed craters. [CR]U - Z[CR]Point T [CR]A rapid succession of craters and double rocks appear. Take this section at the normal speed until you feel comfortable speeding up. [CR]Point U [CR]As soon as the craters and rock end, you will encounter your first 2 tanks. 4 more tanks are waiting for you after a large crater. Fire rapidly to overcome their bullets and destroy them. [CR]Point V [CR]A series of 4 large craters precedes an uphill climb, complete with rolling boulders.[CR]Point W [CR]4 regular craft and 3 elliptical crafts appear while you're positioned closer to the sky.[CR]Point X [CR]3 regular crafts are followed by 3 tri-orb crafts. [CR]Point Y [CR]3 more tri-orb crafts and 3 elliptical crafts fire from overhead while you must avoid a final series of craters and rocks to reach the end of the beginner course.[CR]CHAMPION COURSE[CR]A - E[CR]3 regular craft and 3 elliptical craft bomb you from overhead at the start of the champion course. [CR]Point A [CR]Your first tangle with a rocket car will occur. It will trail behind you until it is ready to strike. Stay fast, and don't do anything until it begins to approach you. When it's half way between you and the edge of the screen, jump up and let it sail underneath you. Fire as soon as you land to destroy it. [CR]Point B [CR]A few tanks occur among craters and rock. The last tank in this section is positioned just after a large crater. It's difficult to destroy both the tank's bullet and the tank, so fire at the bullet and leap over the crater and the tank in one jump. [CR]Point C [CR]More tanks appear with short breaks of craters and rocks. [CR]Point D [CR]4 regular crafts fly in while you must continue to navigate over several deep craters and clear the rocks in your way. Destroy all of the crafts for 800 bonus points. [CR]F - J[CR]Point E [CR]3 pairs of tri-orbs appear, providing a near constant shower of grenades. No bonus points are awarded for destroying all of the crafts because they are considered pairs. [CR]Point F [CR]A tricky succession of craters and rocks occur. They frequently occur back to back, requiring you to clear the rock in front of the crater before jumping, or forcing you to delay your jump so that you can destroy the rock behind the crater. Slow the buggy down if your jumps are landing too close to the next obstacle. [CR]Point G [CR]4 tri-orb crafts are accompanied by 4 regular crafts for a total potential bonus of 1600 points. At the very end of this section, you will be introduced to space plants. Even if you manage to destroy them, remember to jump over the craters. [CR]Point H [CR]3 of the regular and elliptical crafts appear among more craters and rocks. [CR]Point I [CR]4 tri-orb crafts arrive. Destroy them as quickly as possible before the terrain gets more difficult up ahead. Among the craters and rocks are space plants that must be dealt with. Slow the buggy down towards the end.[CR]K - O[CR]Point J [CR]This section starts off with an uphill climb. Boulders now appear more frequently and groups of three are not uncommon. Do not be determined to destroy them all. Leap over a set if they prove too difficult to shoot in time. [CR]Point K [CR]4 regular crafts and 3 elliptical crafts stream onto the screen during your higher elevation.[CR]Point L [CR]Land mines begin to appear again, some in very close proximity to one another. Slow your speed down until you get the rhythm of the jumps. [CR]Point M [CR]More land mines appear. In this section, some land mine pairs are so close that it's actually possible to hurdle the combination at top speed, but this requires great familiarity with the mine sequence before attempting. [CR]Point N [CR]5 tri-orbs appear, for a unique chance at a 1000 point bonus for clearing them all. 4 regular crafts appear as well. [CR]P - T[CR]Point O [CR]As soon as you begin your descent down the hill, five elliptical crafts swarm overhead with four regular crafts. Once you reach the bottom of the hill, a tricky combination of rocks and craters occurs, so clear the crafts as quickly as possible. [CR]Point P [CR]The craters continue to come at a relatively easy pace. A rocket car will appear while you continue to jump craters. The land will level out and eventually the rocket car will launch itself at you. Jump to avoid it, and shoot it as you land, but be ready to jump the next crater which comes up almost immediately. [CR]Point Q [CR]Rocks occur on either side of some craters now, some grouped in pairs. The very end of the section contains closely arranged land mines. [CR]Point R [CR]More rocks and craters show up, with the space plants occupying the later batch. [CR]Point S [CR]5 tri-orbs are accompanied by 3 elliptical crafts. A few rocks show up towards the end. [CR]U - Z[CR]Point T [CR]As the section starts out, a few rocks and craters get in your way before a rocket car appears. This time, it will launch shortly after you land from a jump over a crater, so be ready to jump back up again as the car approaches. [CR]Point U [CR]A number of land mines appear. In the middle, two rocks must be destroyed. Use this as a cue to speed up quite a bit, because a pair of land mines roughly one buggy's width apart must be leaped over simultaneously and you need a good bit of speed. [CR]Point V [CR]A total of 5 tri-orb crafts and 5 regular crafts will appear to launch an attack over you. Continue to monitor forward for craters created by tri-orbs' grenades. [CR]Point W [CR]A rapid succession of craters, rocks, and space plants occur here. It is best to travel at normal or slower speed to ensure that you have time to destroy every obstacle in your way. [CR]Point X [CR]5 tri-orbs and four regular craft will dominate the sky above you. [CR]Point Y [CR]A full combination of tanks, craters, rocks, and space plants will assail you during the very final section of the champion course. [CR]* Hint 1 : When alien ships fly over, keep adjusting your speed or they will eventually hit you with a bomb. Draw their bombs to one end of the screen, then shift to the other. [CR]* Hint 2 : Although the part of the mines seems to be the more difficult, it isn't - all you have to do is not move your tank at all, only pressing the jump button. You won't get many bonus points, but at least you'll survive. [CR]* Hint 3 : The big key to this game is memorization. After the beginner course, you go on to the champion course, which never changes no matter how many times you pass it. Memorize the two courses, and you will almost never lose a life.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]NOTE: Only ports released outside North America are listed here.

				<plot>Pepper II (c) 1982 Exidy.[CR]Despite its name, there was no predecessor named Pepper or Pepper I. The gameplay is similar to the game Amidar by Konami and Stern.[CR]There are four mazes per level in Pepper II. Each maze has exits leading to 3 other mazes. All four mazes must be filled to advance to the next level. To fill in a maze, the player maneuvers "Pepper" around different segments of the maze. As Pepper travels, he leaves a "zipper". Once he encloses or "zips" a segment, it fills in and points are awarded. If Pepper backtracks on an uncompleted segment, it unzips.[CR]The character "Pepper" is an angel. There are two types of enemies that must be avoided: "Roaming Eyes" and the " Whippersnapper" who unzips all uncompleted, zipped segments by moving over them. Pepper's one defense is to enclose an area containing a pitchfork "energizer", which turns him into a devil for approximately four seconds. At that time he can go after all Roaming Eyes for points. At the same time, the Whippersnapper freezes. There are four pitchforks in the corners of every maze. A deluxe energizer is located in the center of each maze. This energizer alternates between being a pitchfork and a halo symbol. If Pepper encloses the middle area when the energizer is a halo, the Whippersnapper will disappear from the maze.[CR]Points are made for enclosing a segment, consuming a pair of roaming eyes when energized by the pitchfork (similar to Pac-Man), obtaining prizes, completing a maze, and completing 4 mazes. A bonus turn is awarded at 40,000, 50,000, 70,000 or 90,000 points, depending on the dip switch settings.[CR]Each maze also contains a prize in one of the segments. The player must enclose the area it appears in to gain the prize and points, and then the prize is shown beneath the maze.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 705.562 Khz)[CR]Sound CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 894.886 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : Custom (@ 894.886 Khz)[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Pepper II was released in May 1982.

				<plot>Popeye (c) 1982 Nintendo.[CR]Popeye is a superb and demanding platform game featuring characters from the famous King Features Syndicate cartoon show of the same name. The aim of the game is to rescue Popeye's girlfriend, Olive Oyl. This is achieved by catching a set number of objects thrown down by Olive from the top of the screen; such as hearts, letters and musical notes. Popeye is constantly pursued in his quest by love rival, Brutus (originally known as Bluto). Popeye must either run away from Brutus or grab some spinach and punch him off the screen (he will, of course, return).[CR]Should any of Olive Oyl's items fail to be caught, they will fall into the water at the bottom of the screen. Popeye will then have only a few seconds to retrieve the object or a life is lost. Several other Popeye characters also make an appearance in the game; namely Wimpy, Swee'Pea, the Sea Hag, and her vulture Bernard. The game's three levels are the dock scene, the street scene and the shipboard scene. These repeat with increasing difficulty.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Most Popeye machines were upright cabinets, but cocktails were also available. The upright was in the standard Nintendo cabinet, the same one used in "Donkey Kong", "Donkey Kong Jr.", "Radar Scope", "Donkey Kong 3", and "Sky Skipper". Almost all other Nintendo titles used alternate versions of this same cabinet. "Mario Bros." was wider, "Punch-Out!!" was taller, etc., but they were still nearly identical. A dedicated Popeye machine will be blue, although you will sometimes see them in different colors (non-blue Popeyes are conversion cabinets).[CR]Model No. TPP2-UP[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : General Instrument AY8910 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (PUNCH)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Popeye was released in December 1982 in Japan.[CR]Licensed to Atari for distribution in Ireland and Great Britain.[CR]* Popeye From Strip To Screen : Popeye the Sailor, one of the most enduring characters in animation history, began not in motion pictures but in E.C. 'Elzie' Segar's 'Thimble Theater' comic strip. Born in Illinois, Segar began cartooning in Chicago in 1914. Graduating to his own strip for the Chicago American, Segar was then hired in 1919 by Hearst's New York Evening Journal to create the syndicated 'Thimble Theater' strip. 'Thimble Theater' depicted the adventures of Ham Gravy, his girlfriend Olive Oyl and her brother Castor. The venture was a success, expanding to an additional Sunday color page in 1924. Segar's comic strip used complex, rambling and frequently eerie narratives that attracted a devoted following, but it lacked strong central characters. In the 'Thimble Theater' of January 17, 1929, Ham and Castor decided to hire a crew to sail in search of the legendary Whiffle Hen. Walking up to a grizzled one-eyed mariner on a dock, Castor asked him, "Are you a sailor?" "`Ja think I'm a cowboy?" came the reply, introducing Popeye to readers.[CR]* Move Over, Ham Gravy : Over a period of months, Popeye developed from a supporting character to the central figure in the hunt for the Whiffle Hen. When Segar finally brought the narrative to a close and tried to retire the sailor, outraged fans contacted the Hearst syndicate demanding more adventures with Popeye. Segar obliged them : the sailor replaced Ham as Olive's love interest, Castor Oyl was reduced to infrequent appearances, and the strip was renamed 'Thimble Theater, Starring Popeye'.[CR]The early 1930s was a period of keen competition among American animation studios for market share. Central to the business strategy of most studios was the development of cartoon 'stars' whose popularity would ensure bookings by major theater chains. Disney followed the success of Mickey Mouse by developing new characters like Donald Duck and Goofy up from supporting roles in Mickey Mouse cartoons. Similar strategies were tried at Warner Bros., where Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck evolved from secondary roles in films starring other animated characters. One of the earliest examples of this took place at the Fleischer Studios, Inc. in New York, where the unpopular starring canine character Bimbo was matched up with a girlfriend in Dizzy Dishes (1930). The girlfriend eventually developed into Betty Boop, the studio's major character. With the popularity of Betty Boop at a peak in 1932, brothers Max and Dave Fleischer decided to introduce a new film series which would include another character to grow into a star. Fleischer rival Van Beuren Corporation had already signed an agreement to bring Otto Soglow's strip 'The Little King' to the screen. Max Fleischer, who was a great fan of Segar's strip, approached Hearst's King Features Syndicate for the right to use Popeye. The two companies signed an agreement on November 17, 1932.[CR]* Betty introduces Popeye to the Big Screen : The production of the first Popeye film took place in secrecy. Veteran animator Roland Crandall was given space apart from the rest of the studio. There, he single-handedly animated the entire cartoon, aided only by the inclusion of some Shamus Culhane animation recycled from the earlier Betty Boop's Bamboo Isle (1932). The results were so satisfying that even before the film was released, the Fleischers and King Features amended the agreement granting the studio the right to produce and release animated cartoons featuring Popeye for a five year period.[CR]Crandall's film 'Betty Boop Presents Popeye The Sailor' opened in the summer of 1933 as part of the 'Betty Boop' series. After a prologue in which newspapers herald the sailor's film debut, and Popeye sings 'I'm Popeye the Sailor Man', the film featured what was to be the standard 'Popeye' series plot, re-enacted with variations by the Fleischers for the next decade. Olive waits for Popeye to disembark from his ship at the dock. Bluto follows the couple to a fairground, where the two sailors compete for Olive's attentions through feats of strength. Bluto abducts Olive and ties her to a train track. As the locomotive approaches, Popeye and Bluto fight. Popeye defeats Bluto, and, through the magical powers of spinach, is able to stop the train and save Olive Oyl. Here, we see the essential difference between the Segar and Fleischer sense of narrative. Segar reveled in picaresque plots that coursed in unexpected directions for up to two years, exploring every novel twist and nuance of narrative. In anticipation of post-modernism, the very concept of plot was old-fashioned to the Fleischers. Hackneyed and ritualized story conventions were torn apart, recombined in odd juxtapositions, and satirized in endless variations.[CR]The Fleischer Popeye cartoons were an instant success. "It might have been just a fluke, a lucky break, that the Segar characters fit the Fleischer style so well", recalls former Popeye animator Myron Waldman. "The animation of Olive Oyl in the mid-1930s was perfect. It fit her. The character had no elbows and the most prominent knees. When she spoke, the voice fit too. This was character. That's what made her so good".[CR]* Step Aside, Mickey : Segar's characters were not the only things consistent with the Fleischer style. Both Segar and the Fleischer staff shared a fondness for a poetically improvisational language. When Popeye's original voice artist, William 'Red Pepper Sam' Costello, left after the first few pictures, he was replaced by a studio in-betweener named Jack Mercer. Much of the dialogs of the Popeye cartoons was post-synched with little attention to synchronized mouth action. Mercer, Mae Questel (Olive's voice, except for the 1938-41 period, when Margie Hines was the voice artist) and William Penell or Gus Wickie, who voiced Bluto, often ad-libbed dialogs during recording sessions, particularly Popeye's 'asides' and pun-filled conversations. Added to this was a progressive softening and increased complexity of Popeye's character, paralleling changes in the strip. Popeye cartoons became the Fleischers' leading attraction. By 1938, Popeye replaced Mickey Mouse as the most popular cartoon character in America.[CR]The Fleischers rummaged through the Segar strip for supporting characters. Bluto, the animated series' antagonist, was a minor character in the Segar strip, appearing only in 1933's 'The Eighth Sea'. Longer-lived strip characters that joined Popeye on the screen included hamburger maven J. Wellington Wimpy, Swee'Pea, Eugene the Jeep and Poopdeck Pappy. While in the comic strip, Popeye gained his great strength from rubbing the Whiffle Hen, the Fleischers added the gimmick of Popeye's power being largely dependent on the ingestion of spinach. Farmers in America's self-styled 'spinach capital' of Crystal City, Texas set up a statue of Popeye in gratitude for the publicity.[CR]As early as 1935, the Fleischers sought backing for a feature-length animated film from their distributor Paramount. Paramount refused to risk money on a feature. In an attempt to persuade the company that longer animated films could be profitable, Max Fleischer initiated the production of three two-reel color 'specials' starring Popeye, beginning with 'Popeye The Sailor Meets Sinbad The Sailor' (1936). Although these 'specials' were often billed over their accompanying feature, Paramount still refused to back the animated feature.[CR]Conditions changed after the success of Disney's 'Snow White And The Seven Dwarfs' (1937) and the Fleischers received money for the eighty minute Gulliver's Travels. According to some sources, the film was originally to have Popeye in the role of Gulliver, but the idea was scrapped early in the planning stages. Perhaps this was unwise. According to internal Paramount correspondence, the Popeye shorts were far more profitable to Paramount than Disney's films were to his distributor, RKO. The sailor's box-office appeal might have helped the Fleischer features. Gulliver's Travels (1938) and the company's next feature, Mr. Bug Goes To Town (1941), bombed, leading to the failure of Fleischer Studios, Inc.[CR]* Post-Fleischer Popeye : The successor company, Famous Studios, continued with the production of Popeye cartoons. Many of these were remakes of earlier Fleischer films. Much of the supporting cast of the Fleischer versions were replaced by new characters, such as identical nephews Pip-Eye, Peep-Eye, Poop-Eye and Pup-Eye. A redesign of the major characters included white U.S. Navy uniforms for Bluto and Popeye (in keeping with their war-time service in the armed forces), and more comely fashions for Olive. Upgraded technology, including the introduction of color to the series in 1943 with Her Honor The Mare and 3-D in Popeye The Ace Of Space (1953), tried to rejuvenate the series. None of these strategies were able to breathe much life into the films. Spooky Swabs (1957) brought theatrical release of Popeye films to a close.[CR]The success of the black and white Popeye cartoons on television in the 1950s inspired several revivals of the series by such talents as Gene Deitch, John Halas and Joy Batchelor, Jack Kinney, and Hanna-Barbera. Hampered by limited budgets and rushed production schedules, none of these came close to the Fleischer or Famous theatrical versions. The less said about Robert Altman's live-action feature with Robin Williams and Shelley Duvall as Popeye and Olive Oyl, the better. What has endured are the original qualities of the Segar and Fleischer works. In fact, Segar's strips have been reissued by Nostalgia Press and the Smithsonian Press. The earlier Fleischer films, which shared the shabby urban or surreal exotic locations and working-class orientation of the Segar originals, retain a vitality and charm that still appeal to a large group of devoted fans today. [CR]* Bluto/Brutus issue : Bluto's name was changed to Brutus after the theatrical Popeye cartoon series went out of production in 1957. It was wrongly believed that Paramount Pictures, distributors of the Fleisher Studios cartoon, owned the rights to the name Bluto. (King Features owned the name all along as Bluto had been originally created for the comic strip.) However, with poor research, they couldn't realize this, and renamed him Brutus to avoid copyright problems. "Brutus" appeared in the 1960-1962 Popeye television cartoons (with his physical appearance changed, making him obese rather than muscular), but he is again "Bluto" (and back to his original muscular physique) in the 1978 Hanna-Barbera Popeye series and the 1980 live-action Popeye movie, as well as the 1987 Popeye and Son series also by Hanna-Barbera. The character was named Bluto in the 2004 movie "Popeye's Voyage: The Quest for Pappy". Nintendo used the name "Brutus" for the character in this arcade game.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]REVISION D (used on most Popeye machines) : [CR]* First level has a black background.[CR]* Default high score is 32,600.[CR]* First nickname on the default high-score table is GET.[CR]* Spinach can only be used once per level, and it is not restored after you lose a life.[CR]* The ladder at the center of the first level can only be used to go down.[CR]* Extra Life dip-switch can be set at 40,000, 60,000, 80,000, or None. The default is 40,000, meaning you get an extra life at 40,000 points.[CR]REVISION F (designed especially for novice players) :[CR]* First level has a colored background.[CR]* Default high-score is smaller than on Revision D : 25,600.[CR]* First nickname on the default high-score table is KAC.[CR]* Spinach is restored after you lose a life.[CR]* The ladder at the center of the first level can be used to go up or down.[CR]* Extra Life dip-switch can be set at 20,000, 30,000, 50,000, or None, with 20,000 as the default.[CR]BOOTLEG :[CR]* No copyright[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Collecting a heart, note, or letter on the...[CR]1st floor : 50 points(1)[CR]2nd floor : 100 points(1)[CR]3rd floor : 300 points(1)[CR]4th floor : 500 points(1)[CR]Punching the punch-bag : 30 points[CR]Punching a bottle : 100 points[CR]Punching a skull : 100 points[CR]Punching Bernard : 1,000 points[CR]Using Spinach power to knock Brutus into the water : 3,000 points[CR]Dropping the bucket on Brutus' head when he's on the...[CR]1st floor : 4,000 points[CR]2nd floor : 2,000 points[CR]3rd floor : 1,000 points[CR]Hitting Swee'Pea's platform from below : 500 points(1)[CR]NOTE : The Punch button is not required to punch Brutus or Bernard when Popeye has Spinach power.[CR](1) denotes values that are doubled if Popeye has Spinach power.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* A Display Glitch : On the musical note level, you can stand at the point on the edge where you 'wraparound' and if you punch a bottle in the right spot, it'll erase part of the 'THRU' sign. This can be done on both sides.[CR]* LEVEL ONE :[CR]1) On the first level, Olive Oyl stands at the top of the screen and throws 24 hearts (one at a time) down to the bottom, hoping that Popeye will catch them all. If a heart reaches the bottom of the screen, you will have about 10 seconds to pick it up before it breaks, costing you one life. Try to catch the hearts as high as possible, since they decrease in value as they get closer to the bottom.[CR]2) When Brutus harasses you, cross the edge of the screen from left to right and wait for him to stop directly underneath the bucket. Hit the punching bag at this point and the bucket will fall onto his head, rendering him helpless for a while. This will score you points based on which floor Brutus is on when you hit him (see Scoring above) and give you some time to catch a few more hearts.[CR]3) Like in the cartoons, Popeye becomes stronger after eating Spinach. A can of Spinach moves between the second and third floors of the screen and you can have Popeye eat it by punching the can. Afterwards, Popeye will turn red and become stronger than Brutus for about 10 seconds (shorter in later levels). If you can punch Brutus at this time, he falls into the sea, temporarily knocking him out, and you will be awarded 3000 points.[CR]4) Brutus will eventually recover so make good use of this time by catching as many falling hearts as possible. They don't move, and they are worth twice as much when Popeye is under the influence of Spinach, so catching some of the higher hearts can really help your score. And since extra lives are only awarded at a very high score (40000 points on most machines; 20000 points by default on Revision F machines), you should be as greedy as possible.[CR]5) Spinach can only be used once per level, and it is never restored after you lose a life (except in Revision F, see Updates above). Do not use it too soon. Collect about two thirds of the total number of hearts, and have as many hearts fill the air as possible before getting the Spinach.[CR]6) If you want to risk getting 4000 points instead of 2000, do not use the punching bag immediately. Wait until you have punched Brutus (best done after eating Spinach) and position Popeye to the punching bag. After Brutus comes out of the sea, he will move underneath the bucket on the bottom floor. With some practice and timing you should be able to drop the bucket onto his head for 4000 points. NOTE : Touching Brutus while the bucket is on his head is not fatal. But be careful, because after the bucket comes off he can easily knock out Popeye.[CR]7) To make up for his lumbering slowness, Brutus is capable of throwing beer bottles at Popeye. You should try to force him to throw bottles as often as possible (four at a time) instead of avoiding them, so you can score extra points.[CR]8) The Sea Hag also throws bottles, except she only throws one at a time. The Sea Hag materializes on the edge of the screen for a moment, chucks a bottle, and disappears. She can also be on both sides of the screen at once. So if you are caught between two Sea Hags or between Brutus and the Sea Hag, you will have to be quick on the joystick and Punch button to survive. [CR]* LEVEL TWO : The second level is much like the first, except Olive Oyl is dropping musical notes now (16 of them, one at a time). The major difference is the layout, with Wimpy on the plank in the lower left corner. If Popeye jumps off the second floor, he will be catapulted up to the third floor. With some careful timing, you can even make Popeye leap all the way up to the fourth floor, where Swee'Pea is waiting on a balloon platform. Touching the bottom of Swee'Pea's platform will score 500 points (1000 points while under the influence of Spinach).[CR]* LEVEL THREE :[CR]1) The setting for the third level is a ship, with a sliding platform on the top floor. At the beginning of the board you should be able to slide Popeye across the platform several times, catching the letters H-E-L-P that Olive Oyl is dropping directly above.[CR]2) Every time Popeye catches a letter, one step is added to a ladder which goes up to Olive Oyl. When the ladder is finished, Olive Oyl is rescued. This is the most difficult level because a total of 24 letters are needed to complete the ladder and save Olive Oyl. Bernard, the vulture, will constantly appear from the left side of the screen. While sliding back and forth across the platform, you should try to punch Bernard as many times as possible, to score 1000 points per punch.[CR]3) After Popeye has rescued Olive Oyl on the third level, there will be an intermission that will have Popeye's face while "I'm Popeye The Sailor Man" plays followed by Popeye blowing his pipe and going "Toot! Toot!". Afterwards, the game begins again with increased difficulty.[CR]On ALL levels, Brutus can reach from underneath or bend down from higher floors to lower ones. Be careful that you are not underneath him. [CR]When the game restarts from the first level with increased difficulty, the Sea Hag will start throwing down deadly bouncing skulls from the edges of the screen that must be punched when they are bouncing upward. You must also make sure that there are no skulls directly above Popeye, since they drop down a floor or two and hit him on the head. [CR]Continue to avoid Brutus, Bernard, the beer bottles, and the skulls, and keep catching whatever Olive Oyl throws down.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Philips G7000 Videopac [FR] (1982) [CR]Philips Odyssey [BR] (1983) [CR]Nintendo Famicom [JP] (July 15, 1983) "Popeye [Model HVC-PP]"[CR]Nintendo NES [EU] (September 1, 1986) "Popeye [Model NES-PP]"[CR]* Computers :[CR]Commodore C64 [EU] (1984)[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Rally-X (c) 1980 Namco, Limited.[CR]In Rally-X, the player drives a car around a maze picking up all of the yellow flags, of which there are ten, before the car's fuel runs out. The game-play has a similar feel to another Namco legend, "Pac-Man"; although in Rally-X, the mazes are much larger and, with each maze having only ten flags to collect, is more sparsely populated than Namco's pill-eating legend.[CR]In-game opponents consist of red enemy cars that try to ram into and destroy the player's car, a problem compounded by the fact that enemy cars are faster than the player's. A smoke screen can be activated which trails behind the player's car and causes any pursuing enemies to crash. Each maze also has rock formations which, if crashed into, will result in the loss of a player car. A radar display to the right hand side of the playing area shows the positions of both the flags, and the enemy vehicles.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG and discrete circuitry for the crash sound.[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (SMOKE SCREEN)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Rally-X was released in October 1980 in Japan.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]In the introduction to the bonus stages, the Namco version misspells 'Challenging' as 'Charanging'. This was corrected in the Midway version.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Collecting a flag : 100 points x the flag collected up to a maximum of 1,000 points. If you lose a life, the points awarded will reset to 100 when you restart.[CR]Collecting the Special Flag : Doubles points for the Special Flag and all flags collected thereafter until you clear the round or lose a life. If you clear the entire round without losing a single life, the tenth flag is always worth 2,000 points because it is guaranteed that at some point, you will have collected the Special Flag. However, losing a life will cancel out the Special Flag's scoring effect when you restart.[CR]End of stage bonus : Points for remaining fuel[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Your only goal is to collect all ten flags as quickly as possible. You need to pay constant attention to two things: the zoomed in view of the world that occupies most of the screen, and the radar view of the world to the right.[CR]* The radar view provides you with two key pieces of information: the relative position of the flags in the world, and the proximity of the enemy cars to yours. Yellow dots in the radar view denote the flags' locations, red dots represent the enemy cars, and the dot flashing black and gray represents you.[CR]* The method you use for collecting the flags is of utmost importance. It is usually best to try to hop from one flag to whichever flag is closest, but the enemies will make that quite difficult to do. As a general rule, do not reverse your direction unless it is absolutely necessary and completely safe to do. If you have to choose between getting close to an enemy to pick up a nearby flag, and abandoning that flag for a farther flag, go for the farther flag. The more distance you put between you and the other cars, the safer you will remain.[CR]* In general, you will be safe off if you choose a direction to collect flags, clockwise or counter-clockwise, and stick to it throughout the duration of the stage. The smokescreen is an invaluable and incredibly tempting tool to use. But if you use it excessively, you will deplete your fuel supply very rapidly, making it more likely that you will run out of fuel before you collect all ten flags, which will almost ensure your demise.[CR]* Challenging stages occur before each maze change, which occurs each time the round number is one less than a multiple of four (the challenging stages occur on the third, seventh, and every fourth round thereafter. In these stages, you are free to collect all of the flags without being harassed by enemy cars until your fuel runs out. However, you can still crash into parked cars and rocks, so be careful.[CR]* Easter Egg : [CR]1) Enter service mode.[CR]2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : UP(x2), DOWN(x7), RIGHT, LEFT(x6)[CR]3) '(c) Namco LTD. 1980' will be added at the bottom of the screen.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Rampage (c) 1986 Bally Midway.[CR]Rampage is a classic B-movie inspired smash-em-up in which up to three players take on the roles of three mutated monsters - George the giant ape, Lizzie the giant lizard and Ralph the giant wolf - who move from city to city destroying skyscrapers and vehicles, while eating or killing any people that get in their way. [CR]The monsters' health can be damaged in a number of ways: by being shot by National Guardsmen, by being hit by another monster, by falling from a building, by being hit by police cars or tanks, by going underwater, by being struck by lightning, or by eating something bad, such as dynamite. Health is replenished by eating food found in damaged buildings. [CR]If the players' health gauge diminishes completely, the monsters will revert back to their original human form and walk sideways off the screen. Rampage has a "buy back in" option, however; if players chose to continue the game before the human figure leaves the play area, the game will continue from that stage. [CR]Rampage is set over the course of 128 days in cities across North America. The game starts in Peoria, Illinois and ends in Plano, Illinois. In Plano, players receive a mega vitamin bonus which heals all the monsters and provides a large point bonus. After this, the cycle of cities repeats five times. After 768 days, the game resets back to Day One. [CR]* Examples of bonuses and hazards found inside damaged buildings: [CR]Food: Milk, Turkey, Hot Toast, Fruit [CR]Bonus: Flower Pot, TV Set, Money Bag [CR]Hazard: Cactus, Poison, Toaster [CR]* Examples of bonuses and hazards found outside damaged buildings: [CR]Bonus: Auto (or Truck), Commuter Train, Person in Manhole [CR]Hazard: National Guard Tank, Police Car, Storm Cloud [CR]Further bonus points can be earned by grabbing a fleeing 'Townie' from a building window. This has two benefits: 1) While holding the Townie, all swat team members disappear from the building windows and 2) accumulating points are scored during the time the Townie is held.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Bally Midway MCR 3 hardware[CR]Game No. 0E36[CR]Main CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 5 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU: Motorola 68000 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips: DAC[CR]Players: 3[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Rampage was released in October 1986.[CR]It was also released as a conversion kit for Star Guards as "Rampage [No. 00F06]".[CR]Rampage incorporates Bally Midway's JOIN THE ACTION feature : each set of game controls includes a corresponding start (Jump) button, which is activated independently. This allows a person, after inserting the proper coinage, to begin play at any time including while the other sets of game controls are in use.[CR]Rampage has an impressive 768 different levels. The 128th level of the game is 'Plano, Illinois', and was the only level in the game with less than three buildings. Brian, one of the designers, said : Plano Illinois was only two buildings because Plano Il is a Tiny town, in which my partner Jeff was born and raised.[CR]These are the random headlines you may encounter during the game.

In addition, you also score points for hitting buildings and collecting bonus and/or food items. [CR]* ITEMS [CR]Bag of loot : 100-500 points. [CR]Boater : 750 points. [CR]Building destroyed : 2,500 points - You will only get the points if your monster destroys the building. Buildings destroyed by things other than you monster will not earn you these points. [CR]Car (parked) : 100 points. [CR]Car (moving slowly) : 200 points. [CR]Car (parked then takes off quickly) : 750 points. [CR]Food such as turkey, milk, fruit, hamburger, or toast : 175 points. [CR]Eating one of the civilians : 500 points. [CR]Flower pot : 500 points. [CR]Helicopter : 750 points. [CR]Holding designated victim : 4,000 - 6,000 points. [CR]Light bulb (off) : 500 points. [CR]Manhole cover (per hit) : 500 points. [CR]Mega-vitamin bonus (every 128 days) : 5,000 points. [CR]National guardsman : 50 points. [CR]Neon sign : 1,000 points. [CR]Paratrooper : 50 points. [CR]Photographer : 750 points. [CR]Police car : 750 points. [CR]Punch causes partial break in building : 25 points. [CR]Punch cause full break/hole in building : 225 points. [CR]Safe (after opening) : 100-500 points. [CR]Tank : 200 points. [CR]Television (off) : 500 points. [CR]Train (per hit) : 500 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]You start the game with your monsters at the bottom of the screen. After the game starts, it is time for you to start the 'urban renewal' process.[CR]* After you start, you will start being attacked. There is no real way to avoid a lot of the attacks by the National Guardsmen due to the sheer volume of fire they are laying down. Your best bet is to keep moving and make yourself a hard target to hit.[CR]* To move quickly from building to building, jump toward the building and push up to grab the building. This enables you to use your monster's ability to both jump and climb at the same time.[CR]* To relieve some pressure from the National Guardsmen, climb up the buildings and smash the windows where they pop out from or just eat them when they are leaning out the window. Move quickly since their buddies are still shooting or throwing dynamite at your monster.[CR]* Unless you are totally obsessed with points, let the National Guardsmen do your work for you. A great example of this is that about midway through a day, a National Guard-man will rush out from the side of the screen with explosives. They will place them at the base of a building. This demolishes the building and helps you along to the next day.[CR]* Another way to destroy buildings is to weaken it up, then jump on the roof. Your monster's weight will cause the building to collapse.[CR]* The air units can be rather dangerous. During the beginning days, the helicopters will overfly your monster, turn around, and then dive in for the attack. You can destroy the helicopters when they are coming in to prevent their attack. Also, when you are moving around, you make it harder for them to get a bead on your monster.[CR]* During the later days, helicopters will drop bombs. Again, paying attention to everything that is going on will allow you to easily escape the bomb being dropped. You can also entice the helicopter to drop a bomb when you are on top of a building. When the bomb is dropped, jump out of the way and let the bomb do the damage to the building for you.[CR]* Make sure that you either grab the food or eat the National Guardsmen to keep your health up. If you can hold out for 128 days, you will get all of your health restored for that day and days 256, 384, 512, 640, and 768. Also keep in mind that if you punch too fast, you may end up getting something that will harm your monster.[CR]* Paratroopers can be a particular pain. If you plan to attack a building with a Paratrooper unit on it, make sure you quickly scale the building and eat said unit. It makes life a lot easier since their rapid fire can put a major hurting on your monster.[CR]* Ground units such as Tanks and Police Cars can be a real nuisance. They fire some pretty heavy shells which not only cause a lot of damage, but they also can knock back your monster for quite a distance. There are some ways to combat these units :[CR]1) Climb quickly up a building. When the unit passes below you, jump down and give it a good punch.[CR]2) Time the shots and rush the ground unit in-between shots to get a good punch in.[CR]3) Use available weapons such as manhole covers, flower pots, or safes to drop on them. These things also allow you to hit them at a distance.[CR]* Be sure and watch what your monster grabs at. There are a lot of hazards in the buildings and it is pretty bad when your monster buys the farm doing dumb stuff such as grabbing electrical items such as toasters and light bulbs.[CR]* In addition to the above, dynamite is sometimes in the middle of buildings. When uncovered, you have about two to three seconds to get your monster out of there before they are blown off the building. Eating it will only decrease your monster's health so run far away when it is uncovered.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Rampage [No. 0E36] (1986, Arcade) [CR]2. Rampage - World Tour (1997, Arcade)[CR]3.

				<title_clean>Classics Horiz - Robotron: 2084</title_clean>
				<plot>Robotron: 2084 (c) 1982 Williams.[CR]Set in the year 2084, Robotron is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which super-intelligent self-aware robots known as 'Robotrons' - designed and built to help mankind - have revolted against their creators and vowed to either reprogram the humans into Robotrons or, failing this, wipe-out the human race entirely. [CR]The player must destroy the robots and rescue the Earth's remaining human families. The player's only weapon is a multi-directional Anti-Robot Laser Gun. Used effectively, it will give players the power to destroy all the Robot waves, with the exception of the indestructible 'Hulk' unit. [CR]At the start of the attack wave, players will have three chances to wipe out the enemy and advance to the next wave. Every 25,000 points players are granted another chance to complete their mission. [CR]MAN, WOMAN, CHILD: These are the only three types of human clones left on Earth. Defenseless and easy prey to the Robots, they are totally dependent upon players for their survival and will wander aimlessly until the player makes contact with them. Touching them will place them under the player's protective powers and earn them the following points: 1,000 for rescuing the 1st human; 2,000 for the 2nd: 3,000 for the 3rd; 4,000 for the 4th; 5,000 for the 5th; and 5,000 for every additional human saved. At the beginning of each new wave and when the player loses a turn, rescue scoring will again begin at 1,000.[CR]- ROBOTRON UNITS - [CR]TANK: Its goal is to kill the player by firing rebounding Shells. Annihilate the Tank for 300 points; the Shell for 50 points. [CR]BRAIN: Red alert. The Brain is the most clever and dangerous of the Robot species. Its two-pronged attack will be launched every fifth wave. If it collides with the player, it will electrocute them where they stand. It also possesses the devastating power to fire Cruise Missiles which will follow the player until either contact is made or they are shot and destroyed. Kill the Brain for 500 points; demolish the Cruise Missile for 75 points. [CR]The victims of the second prong of the Brain's attack are the defenseless humans. If captured, a human will be irreversibly transformed - literally re-programmed by the Brain's incredible mind powers - into a Prog: a Robot that will viciously turn against its own protector, the player. Annihilate the Progs for 100 points or meet a violent death at their hands. [CR]SPHEROID: This pulsating sphere may at first look harmless, but it is the mothership which spawns deadly Enforcer Embryos. Players must try to explode the Spheroid before it ejects the Embryos to earn 1,000 points. [CR]ENFORCER: The Embryos grow into evil Enforcers. Kill them for 200 points. Let them live and they will lessen the player's chance for survival by launching Enforcer Sparks. Destroy the Sparks for 25 points. [CR]HULK: In all attack waves except every fifth, the Hulk will stalk his prey. He alone of the Robot species cannot be killed. The player's Laser Gun can only slow him down or divert him from his objective of crushing all life from the humans and the player. Players must avoid this Robot at all costs or the mission will be lost at the outset. [CR]GRUNT: The least sophisticated species of Robot is the Grunt. He has no weapon and possesses only minimal intelligence. This does not mean he is to be dealt with lightly. He will single-mindedly pursue players to capture and destroy them. Kill him and score 100 points. [CR]ELECTRODES: The pulsating, immobile Electrodes will attempt to block the player's path. A collision with them means instant death. Fortunately, the Grunts will also be annihilated by contact with the player. Electrodes must be avoided or destroyed with the Laser Gun. In each new attack wave they will assume a different shape, but remain just as deadly if contact is made.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Robotron was available in both upright and cocktail format, with the cocktail cabinet being fairly rare. The alternate cabinets also had different graphics (at least the color scheme was different), and are much more difficult to find replacement graphics for. The standard Robotron upright was 6'2" tall and featured white sides and a black front. It had painted side-art in the form of a '2084' logo and a few stripes (this is a very simple design, and is easy to repaint if your cabinet happens to be scratched up). The control panel is covered with a geometric shape design, and has two 8-Way joysticks and two start buttons. These joysticks are of a peculiar design, but can easily be replaced with a pair of modern joysticks (purchase red ball tops ones, because that is what the originals had). The games marquee has the 'Robotron' logo in a font reminiscent of an early 80s computer. This is superimposed over a triangular design made from shapes and lines. The Robotron cocktail cabinet was finished completely with woodgrain laminate. The only graphics were on the control panels, and the small instruction cards that were placed under the top glass. The players would sit across from each other, and the screen image would flip for each player. [CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : M6808 (@ 894.75 Khz) [CR]Sound Chips : DAC [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : Double 8-way joysticks (see 'Trivia' section for more information)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Robotron: 2084 was released in March 1982. [CR]Total production is estimated at 18,000 units. The upright cabinet style is common. Both the cabaret (or mini) and cocktail styles were produced in much lower numbers, one estimate citing only 500 cocktails produced. [CR]The basic play of Robotron was programmed in three days. The design of Robotron was influenced by "Berzerk" and the Commodore PET game 'Chase'. The concept name was 'Robot Wars - 1984'. [CR]The original name for the production was '2084 - Robotron', but the name Robotron was more commonly used by virtually everyone involved, and the game was renamed shortly before production. This is why the cabinet side artwork simply has the number 2084 vertically. [CR]Robotron was unique at the time in that the controls were two 8-way joysticks (one for running, one for shooting) rather than the more typical single joystick and fire button. This unique dual-joystick control was created because of two occurrences : Jarvis liked the game "Berzerk", but hated the joystick-and-button run-and-shoot configuration; and the fact that Jarvis's right hand had been broken in a car accident shortly after he finished creating "Stargate". [CR]This game shares some sounds from "Defender" and "Stargate". [CR]The human characters in this game are named Mommy, Daddy and Mikey. The idea and the inspiration for the character Mikey was from the 1970's commercial for 'Life' cereal. [CR]Williams were sued by Walt Disney Productions for copyright and patent infringement regarding Williams use of 'Tron' in Robotron. Williams won the suit and Walt Disney releases Tron on time. [CR]A Robotron machine appears in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance' and on the 1986 movie 'Better Off Dead'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Yellow/Orange label :[CR]* The default difficulty is 5.[CR]* The demo calls the Quarks 'Cubeoids'.[CR]* The default high score is 131682.[CR]Blue label :[CR]* The default difficulty is 3.[CR]* The default high score is 151782.[CR]* The 'shot-in-corner' bug is fixed.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]G.R.U.N.T.

The scoring starts over when the player is killed or finishes a wave.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your man will be in the middle of the playing field surrounded by various robots. Depending on the wave that you are on will determine exactly what robots are ready to terminate your existence. The game is straight-forward, take out all the robots (except HULKS) to advance to the next wave. It is vital for your survival that you learn how to 'scoot and shoot'. If you don't learn how operate the controls independently and run in one direction while shooting in other directions, you won't survive very long in this game.[CR]* Equally important to 'scoot and shoot' is your ability to be able to fire on the diagonal. It's easy firing up, down, left, and right, but it takes a little more mastery to fire in the diagonal directions.[CR]* Learn the different things the enemy robots do. For example, the SPEROIDS have a tendency to congregate in the corners. This works to your advantage since you can blast about three or four before they discharge their supply of ENFORCER robots.[CR]* Your main objective is to blast a path through the robots and get to the edge of the screen. It doesn't matter what edge, just get to one. The reason is painfully simple : it give the robots one less direction to assault you from. Plus, you can lead them around in circles blasting them and also cleaning out the corners from the above-mentioned ENFORCERS.[CR]* Enforcer Bug : The enforcer bug is when an enforcer is in the lower right corner and you shoot it diagonal there is a 1 in 3,000 chance the game will reset. The reason for the game resetting is there is a bug in the diagonal explosion code for enforcers. The memory below the screen holds the stack and an unclipped pixel can get 'drawn' into the stack causing the game to lock and the watchdog to kick in and reset the system.[CR]* The only times where you won't want to seek the sides is during the BRAIN and TANK robot waves. The BRAINS fire a homing shot at your man so you need as much room to maneuver as possible so going against the wall would restrict that movement. The same goes for the TANK robots which fire bounce shots. They may miss you initially but you might get hit by the shot as it bounces up. You are safer in the middle area where you have room to maneuver. Just watch out for other enemies (which will be very low in number).[CR]* Try to rescue the humans as long as it doesn't put your man in danger of dying. You can rack up some major points on the BRAIN waves since they are loaded with humans for the BRAIN robots to 're-program'. Again, make sure you have an avenue of escape. Doesn't make sense to save a human, get the extra man, then die. You, in essence, gained nothing from that level. You can also shoot the HULK robots to push them away from humans also. On the BRAIN waves, make sure you pick off the BRAIN robots as soon as possible. This prevents them from reprogramming the humans and leaves you more people to get major points with.[CR]* The 'Mikey' bug - on the first Brain wave. There are a lot of Mommies and only one Mikey. The Brains all go for Mikey - if you can protect him (don't pick him up, though!), the Brains will ignore all other humans, making for a point-fest if you can grab them all. As soon as you die, however, the Brains will grab any human they find. This actually works on all Brain waves, but in the other waves the 'golden human' is a random Daddy or Mommy or Mikey, so you don't know who to protect. It's a bug, but a cool one. For this bug to work, the player must make sure that no humans are left alive in the level previous.[CR]* Since you don't have a limit on your shots, you can put up a 'wall' of energy in whatever direction you move. This can have a very devastating effect if applied right.[CR]* Make sure you take a quick look at the wave to assess where the main threats are. You will have from one to two seconds to get ready for action. If you can survive the initial few seconds as you blast your way toward the edge, your chances of survival will be that much greater. Also be sure to remember what each wave has in store for you, this also will give you a greater chance of getting through the wave.[CR]* If you get tired, you can take a break. That's right, wait for a TANK wave. Eliminate all of the robots except for one. After firing a few shots, the TANK robot will run out. After that, it's just a matter of avoiding the TANK and any other pesky robots.[CR]* ENFORCERS, like their SPHEROID transports, tend to congregate in corners. Use this to your advantage.  Every now and then one or two will zip very fast across the field. Their main threat, though, is volume of fire. When you are on the edges, watch out since their shots tend to roll toward your man.[CR]* See all those pretty shapes on the playing field? They are there as a nuisance. They will kill your man if he hits them. They can, however, be shot out of the way but yield no points.[CR]* Robotron Name Trick : The formula consists of three sequences of buttons, that all must be completed within a quarter of a second of each other, without the player dying on-screen. The moves are as follows...[CR]1) Fire Up while moving Right and press Player 1 button.[CR]2) Fire Down while moving Up and press Player 2 button.[CR]3) Move Down while firing Up.[CR]The designer's names will appear and stay on the screen until the joystick is released from the Up position. Your game is over(!) once you've done this trick.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Robotron: 2084 (1982, ARC) [CR]2. Blaster (1983, ARC) [CR]3. Robotron X [Model SLUS-00252] (1996, PSX)[CR]4.

				<plot>Space Harrier (c) 1985 Sega.[CR]Space Harrier is a sprite-scaling 3D shoot-em-up set in the 'Fantasy Zone'; a surreal world composed of abstract structures and a checkerboard landscape. The game's enemies are as abstract as its setting; with creatures including prehistoric Mammoths, alien pods, giant mushrooms and, at the end of most stages, a huge, fireball-spitting Chinese Dragon.[CR]The player's on-screen counterpart carries a portable jetpack under his arm which allows him to fly. The player can also run along the ground to avoid overhead structures and enemies.[CR]In addition to its flight capability, the jetpack is also equipped with a laser, used to destroy both the game's many enemies as well as some (but not all) obstructions, such as the trees and floating rocks on the first stage.[CR]Space Harrier has a total of 18 stages, each with a boss fight at the end. Three exceptions are the bonus stages (5th and 12th) and the 18th stage, which is a 'boss rush' featuring some of the bosses encountered up to that point.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][1] [Sit-Down model][CR][2] [Rolling model][CR][3] [Upright model][CR]Players : 1[CR]Control : stick[CR]Buttons : 3 (FIRE, FIRE, FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Space Harrier was released in October 1985 in Japan.[CR]The pioneer 3-D shooting game realized by a high speed 3-D processing.

				<plot>Sky Kid (c) 1985 Namco.[CR]Sky Kid is a 2-D, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the character Sky Kid. Sky Kid flies around in a bi-plane and is assigned specific targets during the missions. These missions involved bombing specific targets. This would seem easy, however, there are a few obstacles Sky Kid must overcome to get to the target safely. First, the bi-plane is not equipped with the bomb. Sky Kid must pick up the bomb en route to the target. Second, there are both ground and air units that attempt to keep Sky Kid from accomplishing his mission. Last, Sky Kid may have to navigate through some very inhospitable terrain or navigate around cities in order to get to the target. The targets that Sky Kid must bomb will either be a fortress complex or a ship. As one moves farther up in the missions, it isn't uncommon to have multiple targets in one mission. Perhaps barnstorming would have been a better idea.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : SK[CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz), Hitachi HD63701 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Namco 8-channel WSG[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (FIRE, LOOP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Sky Kid was released in December 1985 in Japan.[CR]After Namco ended its partnerships with both Midway and Atari, they started to release games in the United States. Releases such as "Gaplus", "Galaga 3", and "Dig Dug II" were some games that Namco released. Since the big arcade collapse of the early 80's had claimed quite a few arcade companies, Namco managed to fill the gap. Sky Kid was a game that didn't enjoy great success in the United States. The game, however, did show that Namco was on the right track as far as games they released. Featuring cartoon-like graphics and different types of missions, Sky Kid would form the basis of several other Namco games based on the same type of gameplay. To this day, Namco is either releasing new arcade games or it is releasing old classics for the different gaming systems.[CR]Sky Kid is the first game from Namco to allow play for two players simultaneously.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is kind of complicated. You get points for destroying air and ground targets. You then get additional points for how many of these types of targets you destroyed. In addition, you get points based on how much of the target you destroyed.[CR]* Ground Targets :[CR]Truck : 100 points[CR]Tank : 200 points[CR]AA Gun : 100 points[CR]* Sea Targets :[CR]AA Boat : 100 points[CR]Submarine : 100 points[CR]* Air Targets :[CR]Planes : 100 points[CR]Balloon : 100 points[CR]Bomber : 100 points[CR]Bomb : 100 points[CR]* Bomb Hits :[CR]Direct hit, target totally destroyed : 1,000 points[CR]Indirect hit, target partially destroyed : 500 points[CR]You will receive a bonus after you land. This bonus depends on how many of each type of the above targets you destroyed. It is listed in the order of :[CR]Ground and Sea Units[CR]Air Units[CR]Mission Target or Targets[CR]For the first two items, the scoring is:[CR]Units Destroyed : 10-19 - 1,000 Points[CR]Units Destroyed : 20-29 - 3,000 Points[CR]Units Destroyed : 30-39 - 5,000 Points[CR]Units Destroyed : 40-49 - 10,000 Points[CR]Units Destroyed : 50 and UP - 20,000 Points[CR]In regard to targets, bonus points are scored on whether you totally destroy or partially destroy the target or targets.[CR]Partial Destruction :  2,000 points[CR]Total Destruction : 10,000 points[CR]You will also get 10 points per second that you are in the air.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, Sky Kid will be at his airfield in the lower right of the game screen. When the mission starts, you will take off from that airfield. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the left side and no slower then the right side. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick back and forth. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control.[CR]* Remember the controls on this game are not ''reversed''. This means that this isn't like a normal plane where pushing up causes the plane to dive and pushing down causes the plane to rise. Instead, the directions of the joystick will be the direction of the plane.[CR]* Everything that isn't air is hazardous to Sky Kid's plane. This means don't go flying through the forests, cities, or billboards or you will have one less plane.[CR]* Ground units (except trucks) attack in two manners :[CR]a) The tanks just throw up a wave of bullets toward your plane. They aren't very precise but sometimes the volume is enough to knock your plane out of the sky.[CR]b) The anti-aircraft guns fire what is called a ''proximity'' fuzed shell. These types of shells don't have to directly hit the plane to be lethal. Instead, they explode at a pre-set altitude and throw shrapnel in different directions. If Sky Kid's plane gets caught by any of this shrapnel, the plane is lost.[CR]* The sea units also attack in two manners :[CR]a) The anti-aircraft boats throw the 'proximity' fuzed shell.[CR]b) Submarines throw up a wave of bullets then rapidly submerge.[CR]* Enemy fighters will appear both from in front of and also behind Sky Kid. This basically means that ''hugging'' the left or right side of the screen is a bad thing since a collision is highly probable.[CR]* Enemy fighters also seem to sense when Sky Kid's gunsights are locked on them. The enemy planes will do a loop and end up going in the opposite direction over Sky Kid. Keep this in mind when shooting at them since this could cause a collision.[CR]* Just because Sky Kid's plane has been shot full of holes doesn't mean that all is lost. Once your plane has been shot, rapidly press the loop button and you may recover out of the shoot down. Of course, you need to do this right after you have been shot or it won't work.[CR]* When Sky Kid is performing a loop, enemy units cannot hit him with fire. Of course, the disadvantage is that it puts Sky Kid at a higher altitude and it also may place him right in the way of an enemy air unit.[CR]* During the first few missions, the bomb is relatively easy to get. As the missions progress, however, the bomb gets harder to retrieve. Sometimes it will be in a little spot between two trees or it may be at the bottom of a deep valley. Adjust speed and direction accordingly.[CR]* Before you get to the bomb, a prompt 'GET THE BOMB' will appear on the screen a couple of seconds before the bomb gets into view.[CR]* In order to fully destroy a target, you must plant your bomb right in the middle of it.  You will know you have scored a direct hit because the target will explode and then sink.[CR]* Speaking of targets, they are usually heavily defended. Not just by the outside units, but also by the volume of fire they can throw skyward to shoot down your plane.[CR]* When you are approaching your airfield to land, make sure that you aren't in one of your enemy's gunsights. Enemy units sometimes will fire on you until you get on the runway. Nothing like almost getting to the airfield only to get shot down.[CR]* As the missions progress, the distances also get longer. You will know how far you are when the prompt 'HALFWAY POINT' shows up on the screen. If you get shot down before the halfway point, you start from the airfield. If it is after the halfway point, you start from the halfway point.[CR]* If you shoot the dancing girls around the airfield when you are coming in, they turn into pink flowers.  Not worth any points but I guess a great way to line up your gunsights.[CR]* If you overshoot the runway, you will run out of fuel and crash. You still, though, get the extra bonuses but you lose a plane in the process.[CR]* Make sure you watch the terrain at all times. Sometimes mountains, billboards, cities, etc. will appear at the worst possible times. Of course, you can also use these to your advantage since enemy air units also get destroyed by these features[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Sky Kid (1985)[CR]2. Sky Kid Deluxe (1986)[CR]3. Vs.

				<plot>Tapper (c) 1983 Bally Midway.[CR]Taking on the role of an overworked bartender, the player must serve beer to the ever-thirsty patrons that populate his bar. All customers must be served before they work their way up to the beer kegs. Empty glasses must also be collected before they slide off the end of the bar and smash to the floor. Extra points are awarded for collecting tips, while bonus rounds involve locating the one beer that has not been shaken, and serving it. The game features four different levels :[CR]1. Cowboys[CR]2.

The Suntory version was a Sega board, Suntory is a Japanese beer (see "Updates" section for more information).[CR]The main character in the game (as well as the main character of two other Bally Midway games; "Domino Man", and "Timber") is based on a Marvin Glass employee called Mike Ferris, who had the same distinctive mustache and bald head and reputedly wore a red T-shirt all of the time.[CR]The music for the third stage (the punk bar) was loosely inspired by new wave music group Devo's song 'Workin' in the Coal Mine'.[CR]Tapper was play tested in a Chicago-area Rush Streetbar called 'The Snuggery' and received much positive feedback from the bar's patrons. Digitized belches were originally going to be used in the game, but, perhaps thankfully, they never made it into the final version.[CR]The cabinet is designed to resemble a real bar - replete with a brass foot rail and two brass drink or ashtray holders (one on each side of the control panel). The cabinet and gameplay on the beer version features the Budweiser logo. The pour spouts have mock-up Budweiser handles that closely resemble the Budweiser taps that appear in real bars throughout the world.[CR]Approximately 3300 Tapper uprights were made and around the first 100 or so were released with colour side art. About 300 cocktail machines were also made.[CR]The main character appears on the 2012 Disney animated movie Wreck-It Ralph, during the Bar scene. It should also be noted that despite the game in the movie being Root Beer Tapper, the main character wore his outfit from the Budweiser version.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]* Suntory version has different graphics and most likely different music.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Serving a cowboy/girl patron with beer : 50 points.[CR]Serving a sports bar patron with beer : 75 points.[CR]Serving a punk patron with beer : 100 points.[CR]Serving an alien patron with beer : 150 points.[CR]Collecting an empty beer glass : 100 points.[CR]Collecting a tip left on the bar : 1,500 points.[CR]Guessing the correct can on the bonus screen : 3,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Easter Egg : In the attract mode, wait until the word Tapper is filling up with beer, and hold down the joystick, both taps, and the player 1 &amp; 2 buttons. You will then see the names of the game designers.[CR]* Take your time in the first few levels. You can make a high score by leaving one person and waiting for more people.[CR]* The last guy in the row will almost always leave a tip.[CR]* If a person leaves the bar in the first level you get 50 points but, if you let them get close to the end of the bar, they will drink the beer and stay. It's 100 for getting the empty mug.[CR]* The longer you stay in the level, the faster the people and mugs move.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Designed and programmed by : Steve Meyer[CR]Graphics by : Scott Morrison[CR]Sounds by : Rick Hicaro[CR]Support by : Elaine Ditton[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]NOTE : All ports released in 1997 and later feature the 'Root Beer' version.[CR]* Consoles :[CR]Atari 2600 [US] (1983) "Tapper [Model 010-01]" [CR]Colecovision [US] (1984) "Tapper [Model 2616]" [CR]Atari XEGS[CR]* Computers : [CR]BBC Micro [EU] (1983) [CR]PC [Booter] [AS] (1983)[CR]Commodore C64 [EU] (1983) [CR]Commodore C64 [US] (1983) "Tapper [Model 010-05]" [CR]Sinclair ZX Spectrum [EU] (1985)[CR]Atari 800 [US] (1984) [CR]Apple II [US] (1984) [CR]Amstrad CPC [EU] (1987) "Tapper - Official Arcade Game"[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Classics Horiz - Timber</title_clean>
				<plot>Timber (c) 1984 Bally Midway.[CR]Timber is an abstract action game in which one or two players assume the role of a lumberjack and have a limited amount of time to chop down a given number of trees that pop up from the ground. The game is controlled with two joysticks, with one stick controlling the player's movement and the other corresponding to left or right chops with the player's axe. Difficulty increases with each level, with the number of trees needed to be chopped down gradually increasing (maxing out at 19) and the allotted time decreasing. [CR]During a round players must avoid beehives that are thrown at them by grizzly bears. The beehives, however, can be destroyed with the player's axe for a 500-point reward. Some trees contain birds that will run around the level after they have been chopped down, awarding 1,000 points if touched by the player.[CR]Every couple of levels players are given the opportunity to amass bonus points. The bonus round begins with the lumberjack standing on a floating log. As the log begins to rotate, players must use their reflexes to stay on top of the log. The first two times this is played, the log is relatively large; on future attempts, the size of the log shrinks considerably. The bonus round ends if the player falls off the log or balances atop it for the duration of the round, in which case 1,000 bonus points are earned.[CR]The two-player simultaneous mode can be played either competitively or cooperatively. In this mode, chopping or pushing down a tree such that it falls on the opponent awards you with 1,000 points.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][No. 0B60][CR]Bally Midway MCR 3 hardware[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 5 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Timber was released in October 1984.

				<title_clean>Classics Horiz - Wizard of Wor</title_clean>
				<plot>Wizard of Wor (c) 1980 Midway.[CR]Welcome to WIZARD OF WOR! In this magical game, you are a worrior descending into deep dungeon mazes, battling invisible monsters, cacodemons, and maybe even the Wizard of Wor himself! Be of good cheer, worrior, for herein lie many of the secrets of the Wizard. [CR]Wizard of Wor is a game for 1 or 2 players. When the 2-player mode is selected, both players control their worriors at the same time. Teamwork in the 2-player mode is very important (but not necessary to play). [CR]The object of Wizard of Wor is to descend as far into the dungeons of Wor as possible, killing monsters, beating the Wizard, and earning as high a score as you can. The game ends when all the players' worriors have been destroyed. [CR]At the start of the game, you are placed in dungeon one. It contains six blue Burwors. Using the joystick and fire button, maneuver your worrior around the maze and shoot them. As you shoot the last Burwor, a yellow Garwor will come out. Garwors and red Thorwors will turn invisible. The radar will show the positions of the invisible monsters. Invisible Garwors and Thorwors will become visible when they enter the same corridor that a worrior is in. As time goes by, the monsters speed up. The longer it takes before you shoot them, the faster they go. When you have destroyed the Thorwor, the first dungeon ends. [CR]In the 2nd dungeon, a different maze is randomly selected. Once again, six Burwors are placed here. More Garwors and Thorwors will appear this time, however. When the last Thorwor has been shot, Worluk will come out and try to escape out one of the side doors. If you shoot him before he escapes, all point values will be doubled in the next dungeon. After Worluk has been shot or has escaped, the Wizard of Wor may then appear. He teleports closer and closer, continuously firing lightning bolts. He continues to do so until either one worrior has been destroyed, or the Wizard has been shot. [CR]After dungeon 3 or 4, a bonus player is awarded (option switch selectable). You must then face the Arena. This is the toughest of the lower level dungeons. The Worlord dungeons begin at dungeon eight. They are very difficult to survive. At dungeon thirteen, another bonus player is awarded, and you must try to win your way through The Pit. The ultimate goal of Wizard of Wor is to survive The Pit without losing any worriors. [CR]In a 1-player game, the other worrior (blue) is your friend. He will not shoot you unless you come between him and a monster, then he will try to shoot the monster, and you could be hit by his shot. [CR]In a 2-player game, both players play at the same time. They do not take turns. The two players may elect to shoot each other. But, if you wish to survive for long, you must use teamwork! [CR]And now worrior, go forth and do battle with the Wizard of Wor![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Wizard of Wor arcade units came in a white dedicated cabinet with sticker sideart of a menacing looking wizard. Cabaret and cocktail versions were also common (The cabaret models had wood grain paneling with no sideart, while the cocktail versions had the monitor mounted sideways for some reason).[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.789773 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) Astrocade (@ 1.789773 Mhz), Votrax SC-01[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 320 x 204 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 256[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick (that had 2 positions for each directions)[CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]This game featured some early speech synthesis that was done in a similar manner to that in "Gorf" (Gorf and Wizard of Wor ran on nearly identical hardware). Here is a list of the phrases the Wizard says throughout the game :[CR]Insert coin and game over mode :[CR]1) Hey! Insert Coin![CR]2) Find me ...The Wizard of Wor.[CR]3) I'm out of spite, ha ha ha ha![CR]Get ready or coin acceptance mode :[CR]1) Get ready, worrior.[CR]2) You better hope you don't find me, the Wizard of Wor.[CR]3) Another coin for my treasure chest.[CR]4) Ah good!

Ha ha ha ha![CR]10) You'll never leave Wor alive! Ha ha ha ha![CR]11) If you destroy my babies, I'll pop you in the oven! Ha ha ha ha![CR]12) Burwor hasn't eaten anyone in months. Ha ha ha ha![CR]13) My babies breathe fire worrior.[CR]14) I'll fry you with my lightning bolts.[CR]15) Burwor, Garwor, and Thorwor will do you in.[CR]16) My creatures are radioactive.[CR]Bonus player awarded :[CR]1) You'll get ...The Arena! Ha ha ha ha![CR]2) Another worrior for my babies to devour.[CR]3) Keep going and you will find me.[CR]4) A few more dungeons and you will be a Worlord.[CR]5) Worrior fear, I draw near, each time I appear.

That was fun![CR]When you have reached the Worlord dungeons, the Wizard calls you Worlord, instead of worrior.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Burwor (Blue Monster) : 100 points[CR]Gurwor (Yellow Monster) : 200 points[CR]Thorwor (Red Monster) : 500 points[CR]Yellow or Blue Worrior : 1,000 points[CR]Worluk : 1,000 points + Double Score for Next Dungeon[CR]Wizard of Wor : 2,500 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]The game progresses through a series of dungeon mazes, each one deeper in the caverns of Wor. One other worrior accompanies you into the dungeons, and if you wish to survive for long, you should work with him to conquer the monsters you will encounter. At the start of each dungeon, there are blue Burwors moving around the maze. As you destroy them, yellow Garwors come out, and as you destroy them, red Thorwors take their place. When the last red Thorwor is shot, winged Worluk comes out (not in the first maze). Try to shoot him before he escapes out one of the side doors, as that will double all the point values for the next dungeon. After Worluk has escaped or been shot, the Wizard of Wor might show up. He uses a powerful teleport spell to jump himself from place to place in the dungeon, all the while firing lightning bolts. He keeps reappearing until one worrior has been destroyed, or he himself has been shot. If any worriors are left, the next dungeon is entered. This sequence of events continues until all of the player's worriors have been vanquished.[CR]In the basic dungeons, a worrior can learn the fundamentals of survival. It is very easy to walk blind around a corner, into the mouth of a waiting monster. When the monsters are really moving, they are faster than you are. This makes running away difficult. There is a point where you will have to turn and fight them before they eat you.[CR]Your worrior is easy to operate - a 4-direction joystick for movement in the dungeons, and a fire button for the concentrated unified-field-disturbance rifle. The joystick has two contacts in each direction, a direction contact and a movement contact. A light tap to the joystick will face your worrior in a certain direction, without moving him out of position. To move your worrior, just hold the joystick over in one direction.[CR]The unified-field-disturbance rifle is easy to use. It fires in the direction your worrior is facing. It operates on the principle of a concentrated unified-field-disturbance area coupled with a displacement through 4-space. This means that it can create only one disturbance at a time, and the disturbance must continue moving until it expands its energy on some object, usually a monster or a wall of the dungeon.[CR]Only one shot can be in the air at a time. This means that in a short corridor you will be able to fire rapidly, because your shot will always quickly encounter a wall. In a long corridor, the shot stays in the air for a long time, leaving you in hot water if a monster is approaching from the side.[CR]If your shot occasionally seems to go in the wrong direction, it is because your worrior has not fully rounded a corner before firing. Your shot went in the direction you were just facing, not in your new direction. Learning when not to shoot is an important part of the strategy of this game.[CR]Entering the dungeon is simple to do, but at times, particularly in the Worlord dungeons, choosing the right time to enter can be a little tricky. At the start of each dungeon, you have ten seconds to bring your worrior into the maze. To do so, just push the joystick toward the maze. When your worrior comes out, he is facing the radar screen. If you do not bring the worrior out of the ready box immediately, the ten second count-down begins. The numbers of the count are shown next to the ready box. At the end of the ten seconds, your worrior will automatically be brought into the dungeon. At the beginning of a dungeon, all the monsters are started away from the 2 ready boxes. But since the monsters move randomly at first, they can start to move closer to you. Also, when a worrior has been destroyed, you may immediately bring a new worrior into play. However, monsters might be milling about next to your ready box. To avoid being eaten, wait for the monsters to clear the area before bringing your worrior out. It is important to note that a new worrior can be brought in at any point during play. If you get eaten or shot, just bring in another worrior and have at it! This is particularly useful with Worluk, who may eat you once, but not escape immediately. It is often possible to bring a second worrior in, and kill Worluk for double score on the next dungeon, before he escapes.[CR]In a one player game, the blue worrior is controlled by the computer. He is a first in video gaming, as he is your friend inside the machine. He will never shoot at you, he shoots only at monsters. Sometimes, he will even save your life by shooting a monster sneaking up behind you. Be careful not to get between him and a monster, for he will still try to shoot the monster, and you might catch his shot.[CR]Teamwork is also a major point of strategy in Wizard of Wor. In the basic dungeons, there are places where two worriors can cut off the monsters as they try to enter the corridor where the worriors are standing. This position is strong but not invincible. The monsters, particularly the last few monsters left in a maze, are moving fast enough to occasionally duck in between shots, and eat you. Back to back in a short corridor is good teamwork. Note that the two worriors can pass through each other unhindered. But be careful! When you are close together, it's very easy to accidentally shoot each other.[CR]In the early mazes, it is to your advantage to initially go out and shoot as many monsters as you can. This is because the monsters move slowly at first, but get faster later. The more slow monsters you shoot, the fewer fast monsters will be left to eat you. When the monsters speed up, then find a good teamwork spot. In the upper level mazes, the Worlord dungeons, the critical thing is to not miss a shot, for if a shot misses a monster, it is likely to travel a long way before hitting a wall, and in that time a monster will probably come along and eat you. In some of the Worlord dungeons, there are places that two worriors can defend effectively, but they are very hard to get to, and often one player might loose a worrior trying to move into position. When you reach the Pit, you're on your own...[CR]There are 2 levels of overall difficulty in the dungeons - basic dungeons and Worlord dungeons. In addition, there are 2 special dungeons, the Arena and The Pit, which occur at special times during play.[CR]Each dungeon consists of an 11-by-6 matrix of squares, with a wall or opening on the sides of each square. The maze is symmetrical around the center vertical axis. Every maze has a side escape door located four squares up from the bottom, and on each side of the maze. Going out the door on one side brings you in the door on the other side. This can be confusing at first, but becomes quite handy when you get used to it. After using the side escape door, it remains closed for a short amount of time before reopening.[CR]When Worluk is out, the door always remains open. Proper use of the side escape door will sometimes aid in escaping trouble, and can also help to cut off Worluk before he escapes. The basic dungeons consist of many short passages with many possible different pathways, and some long corridors. At first glance, the long corridors appear to be the most strategic spot, but this is not true. Due to the firing mechanism, it is usually the most dangerous spot, as you are not able to fire very often. Finding good places for team work is relatively easy here. In the area between the radar screen and the dungeon, a description of some current important aspect of the game is displayed. In dungeon one, the word RADAR is shown, indicating to the novice player the function of the radar.[CR]On other dungeons, the level of the current dungeon is indicated. When Worluk comes out, the word WORLUK is displayed there, as is WIZARD OF WOR when he shows up. It tells when either of these has ESCAPED. And it tells when DOUBLE SCORE has been earned for shooting Worluk. It also tells you of THE ARENA and THE PIT.[CR]Below the bottom of the dungeon is the radar. This shows you the location of every monster in the dungeon, visible and invisible. It is important to learn to use the radar to anticipate a monster coming from behind. The only creatures that do not show on the radar are the worriors and the Wizard himself. When you have reached dungeons eight and above, you have become a Worlord. Now you have the honor of testing your skill in the Worlord dungeons. These dungeons are much tougher, there are fewer walls and more open spaces. If even one shot misses, and travels the long distance down to the opposite wall, a monster will very likely come up and gobble you down. Finding and establishing yourself in solid strategic positions is very difficult. It is easy to have several worriors chomped up in a row. Sometimes the monsters will line up along one edge of the maze - a lovely parade. However, if just one monster starts approaching from the top, watch out![CR]The Arena is the dungeon that comes when the 1st bonus player is awarded. Since the bonus player is switch selectable for the fourth or the fifth maze, the same switch will also control the appearance of the Arena. It is the most difficult maze of the basic dungeons, featuring an arena. This is a large open area in the middle of the dungeon, with openings level with the side escape doors. This is a preview of the Worlord dungeons and The Pit.[CR]Surviving The Pit is the ultimate goal of Wizard of Wor. The Pit occurs at the 13th dungeon, and every 6th dungeon thereafter. In other words, the 19th, 25th, 31st, etc. dungeons are The Pits. One missed shot here is almost certain to be fatal. The Wizard is particularly deadly here, as there is nowhere to hide. A bonus player is awarded at the first Pit. The other Pits do not award a bonus player. Sophisticated maneuvering, intestinal fortitude (guts), and a bit of luck are needed to make it through The Pit unscathed. Surviving The Pit without losing a worrior earns you the title of Worlord Supreme. Best of luck![CR]The Wizard of Wor loves to hear the patter of little feet running through his dungeons. So he created some lovely beasties, known as Worlings. Burwor is beautiful, bouncing blue. 6 of them exist on each dungeon level. They always remain visible. This is because the Wizards favorite color is blue. As each Burwor is shot, a Garwor may come to take his place. Garwor is kind of overfed, and waddles a bit, but he has yellow scales that are just delicate. As Garwors are shot, Thorwors are teleported in to take their place. Thorwor is sleek and dangerous red.[CR]All of these monsters can shoot an occasional lightning bolt. Only Garwor and Thorwor have the Wizards spell of invisibility. They become visible when they enter the same corridor as a worrior, and when they are initially teleported in.[CR]In the 1st dungeon, when the last Burwor is shot, he is replaced by a Garwor. When a monster is placed in the dungeon, it is at a random location, somewhere away from both worriors. In the 2nd maze, the last 2 Burwors are replaced by Garwors. The progression continues until the sixth dungeon, when all six Burwors are replaced by Garwors. Whenever a Garwor is shot, he is replaced by a Thorwor. So, in the first dungeon, there are a total of 8 monsters : 6 Burwors, 1 Garwor, and 1 Thorwor. In the 2nd maze there are a total of 10 monsters : 6 Burwors, 2 Garwors, and 2 Thorwors. In the 6th dungeon, there are a total of 18 monsters : 6 Burwors, 6 Garwors, and 6 Thorwors. This is the maximum number of monsters in 1 dungeon level. Note that there are really no more than 6 monsters in one dungeon at any 1 time. It just seems like there are more.[CR]All of the monsters work on a speed-up timer. This timer increments the speed of the monsters every time it counts down, which is about every seven seconds. A Garwor that replaces a Burwor will start at the speed the Burwor was going when destroyed. The same is true for Thorwors. So, in the early mazes, Garwors and Thorwors end up going faster than Burwors, although, given enough time, Burwors can get moving as fast as any monster. In dungeon 4 and before, any monster traveling at top speed will always be visible. In later dungeons, Garwors and Thorwors will still become visible at top speed. In dungeon 7, the Burwors start at top speed. Any monster traveling at this speed is not able to shoot lightning bolts.[CR]Worluk... the Wizard's favorite : In the 2nd dungeon and beyond, Worluk will come out after the last Thorwor has been shot. Worluk is a lightning quick Cacodemon. He's the Wizards favorite. He flies erratically through the maze, trying to reach one of the side escape doors. The Wizard tried to train him to fly to the door on the opposite side of the maze that he is initially teleported to. However, Worluk's chaotic nature leads him to frantically fly about, sometimes flying out the side escape door closest to him. If you shoot Worluk, all the scores in the next dungeon are doubled. This means that killing Worluk is essential for high scores. A good strategy is to position your worrior by the door that Worluk should use to escape. If Worluk should eat your worrior, bring the next one immediately into play, and go after him again! Remember, he is worth double score on the next maze. But, at the moment that Worluk has been shot, beware worrior! For it is then that the Wizard of Wor might choose to appear.[CR]The Wizard of Wor : Even at a young age, the Wizard showed promise in the mystic arts. But it took many dangerous encounters and many years of research and study to sharpen his skills to his current high level. Over the centuries, the Wizard has retained his chaotic sense of humor, much to the chagrin of worriors entering his dungeons (see the list of phrases).[CR]The Wizard will sometimes come out after Worluk has been shot. He uses multiple teleport spells to pop around the dungeon, eventually homing in on one worrior or the other. All the while, he wildly fires lightning bolts in every direction. At first he teleports some distance away from one worrior. Then, on successive teleports, gets closer and closer. Note that if the two worriors are very near each other, the Wizard may teleport right next to one of them the very first time. This is because he was teleporting a certain distance away from the other worrior, and happened to come up right next to the first worrior.[CR]The Wizard will continue to teleport and fire lightning bolts until either one worrior has been destroyed or the Wizard has been shot. Shooting the Wizard does not kill him; it only banishes him until the next dungeon. In almost every dungeon there is a possibility that the Wizard could show up. This possibility is based on the level of the dungeon you are currently in, and on the total number of worriors left in the game. However, even at the highest dungeon level, it is not certain that he will appear.[CR]Standing in a long corridor when the Wizard is teleporting in can be quite risky. If he comes up in that corridor, he will have a clear shot at you.[CR]As you get deeper into the dungeons, the Wizard stays for a shorter period of time, and teleports even faster. This means he gets closer a lot faster, so you must try and shoot him soon after he first comes out. Otherwise, he may end up teleporting right next to you! The Wizard loves to fool worriors by teleporting behind them. But watch out, he will also surprise you by popping up right in front of you.[CR]The Wizard says, 'Scores of 150,000 or more are exceptional'. Now, you're off to see the Wizard, the magical Wizard of Wor.[CR]* Hints for game play :[CR]1) Take a quick look at the maze before you go into it. Know the locations of the monsters and also find areas that will be suitable for defending yourself. The Burwors will already be roaming around. In the later levels, a couple of Garwors and Thorwors will also be in the maze.[CR]2) When playing in 1-player mode, the computer player will assist you to a degree. Use this to your advantage. This will be especially true in the later levels when the invisible monsters are roaming the maze. The computer player can help you by making them become visible. Keep in mind that you can kill off the computer Worrior and they can do the same to you.[CR]3) Two-player works like one player. Learn to work together and try not to kill each other (unless you are playing a cut-throat competition).[CR]4) It is easier to turn from side to side then it is to turn from side to up/down. Find the short walls that will only allow monsters to approach you from the side. Also, align your warrior just a little past the corridor walls above and below. This will give you the advantage of seeing invisible monsters in two vice one passageway.[CR]5) Another advantage of the above is the fact that the monsters will push you back vice kill you. Of course, you must get back into position since the monsters seldom will attack you singly in the later dungeons.[CR]6) Learn to tap the joystick so you can rapidly turn without moving your Worrior. This will prove invaluable on the later levels when you have to turn back-and-forth rapidly to shoot the enemies coming at you.[CR]7) Learn to use your radar. Although it doesn't have the maze superimposed upon it, you can get a pretty good idea of where the invisible monsters are and where they are moving to. This will definitely help decrease the chance of being surprised by one of them.[CR]8) When you are shooting, make sure you are making your shots count. You can only have one shot out at a time. This basically means that until your shot hits a wall or a monster, you have no firepower. So don't fire down long corridors or you may find yourself surrounded by monsters without being able to shoot them.[CR]9) Your shots can also be negated by the other Worrior's shots, monster's breath weapons, and the wizards lightening bolts.[CR]10) As the dungeons progress, the monsters become smarter. Not only do they attempt to surround your character, they also move out of the way when you are aiming at them. In addition to becoming smarter, they move much quicker and tend to swarm on your Worrior.[CR]11) You can use the warp tunnel once during a dungeon. It will also clear out when the Worlock appears.  When you use the warp tunnel, it will seal off behind you as you get to the other side. Only use it when you really need to. Don't hang around it since the monsters will also use it to get to your location.[CR]12) The Worlock will appear after the last monster has been killed. Worlocks usually appear in the center of the maze and move toward one of the war tunnels. Try to seal off the warp tunnel to prevent the Worlocks escape. Also, hit it at long range since trying to fight toe-to-toe with it would be suicide.[CR]13) After you clear out the Worlock, you may be confronted by the Wizard of Wor himself. The Wizard of Wor teleports randomly about the maze shooting off lightening bolts. This may be the one time when a pre-emptive shot may do you some good since the wizard may teleport into your shot. You can also use the same tactics of creeping out from behind a wall with the wizard since you won't be hit until you are pushed back into the corridor.[CR]14) If you survive through dungeon 7, you will now be classified as a Worlord. This basically means all the monsters are moving at maximum speed and they are all coming for you.[CR]15) If you don't lose a Worrior on the dungeons with the Pit, you will be classified as a Worlord Supreme.[CR]16) For the mazes that are open (such as the Pit) or very near open (such as the Arena), go to a corner to present the smallest possible target and to force the monsters to only come at you in two directions.[CR]17) While you are playing the game, if you turn the power off and back on quickly, you will start where you left off and your total amount of Worriors left will be at their maximum of 16.[CR]18) After the dungeon counter (located above the radar) passes 100, it will reset but the 1st digits will no longer by in synch with the counter.[CR]19) It is rumored that if you fire a shot and the Wizard of Wor first appears in the exact same spot where your shot is, the game will lock up.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Developer: David Nutting Associates[CR]Designed and programmed by: Tom McHugh, Dave Nutting[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Atari 5200 [US] (1981) "Wizard of Wor [Model 4L 2713]" [CR]Atari 2600 [US] (1982) "Wizard of Wor [Model 80000]" [CR]Bally Astrocade [US] (1982) "The Incredible Wizard [Model 2017]" [CR]Colecovision [US] (Unreleased prototype) [CR]Atari XEGS [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [AU] (2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [US] (October 11, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2 [Model MWO-3201W]" [CR]Nintendo GameCube [US] (October 11, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2 [Model DOL-GAYE-USA]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [US] (October 11, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2 [Model SLUS-20997]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [EU] (October 29, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [EU] (October 29, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2 [Model SLES-52844]"[CR]Sony PSP [US] (December 13, 2005) "Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play [Model ULUS-10059]"[CR]Sony PSP [EU] (February 24, 2006) "Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play [Model ULES-00180]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [US] (November 6, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [US] (November 6, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins [Model BLUS-31083]"[CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [EU] (November 15, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [EU] (November 15, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins [Model BLES-01768]"[CR]* Computers : [CR]Atari 800 [US] (1981) [CR]Commodore C64 [US] (1983) "Wizard of Wor [Model C-64615]" [CR]Commodore C64 [EU] (1983) [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [US] (February 17, 2006) "Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition"[CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [EU] (March 17, 2006) "Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition" by Zoo Digital Publishing[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Zoo Keeper (c) 1982 Taito America Corp.[CR]Zoo Keeper is a superb, fast-paced arcade game in which the player takes control of Zeke the zookeeper. Many of the animals at Zeke's zoo are running wild and have captured Zeke's girlfriend, Zelda. Zeke must recapture as many animals as possible and rescue his sweetheart from the animals' clutches.[CR]Zoo Keeper features two different, alternating play fields, with each level having its own task to complete; as well as a final 'bonus screen'. The three levels are as follows :[CR]On the first play field, players must move Zeke around the outside of an animal enclosure, constantly re-building the enclosure wall that the animals are set on destroying. Any wild animals that are loose must be jumped over or the player will lose a life. The level's timer is represented as a fizzing fuse, and along this fuse are a number of bonus items such as beer or a net for catching escaped animals. When the timer's fuse reaches an item, it will appear on screen and can be picked up. Once the timer makes it to the word 'End', the current level is completed and play moves on to the next level. The bonus items that occasionally appear include mugs of beer, ice cream sundaes, clover clubs, watermelons, etc.[CR]If Zeke manages to pick up a net, he will be able to capture the animals and put them back into the Zoo. The net will eventually disappear and the captured animals will try to escape once more by breaking through the enclosure wall. Zeke will have to continue building the wall around the Zoo until the time is up. At the end of the level, bonus points are awarded for every animal inside the wall. Animals found on this level are snakes, moose, camels, rhinos, elephants, and a lion.[CR]On the second, more difficult play field, Zelda is tied to a palm tree and Zeke must rescue her by jumping to the top of the screen via a series of moving platforms; dodging the coconuts thrown by a mischievous monkey. On each of the platforms, various foods and drinks can collected to earn extra points. Sometimes, one of the ledges will have a 'Free Game' sign that will grant the player a free credit. While Zelda is tied up, she says 'save me', and whenever Zeke gets knocked out by one of the deadly coconuts, she says 'Oh, no!' If Zeke makes it all the way to the top and rescues her, she says 'My Hero' and a bonus of 5,000 points is awarded.[CR]The first and second screens are alternated before the player finally reaches the third and final 'bonus screen'. Here, Zeke must jump over the herds of charging animals that are running from a cage at the foot of an escalator. Zeke must reach the escalator behind the animals' cage and make his way up to the next floor, where a second escalator - replete with more charging animals - awaits. Zeke must reach the top of the second escalator to rescue the trapped Zelda.[CR]After Zeke has rescued Zelda on the final screen, the game begins again with an increased level of difficulty.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Upright cabinet dimensions : 67'' (170cm) High x 24'' (61cm) Wide x 30'' (76cm) Deep.[CR]Upright cabinet weight : 280 lbs (126kg).[CR]Prom Stickers : ZA03-ZA10 / ZV03-ZV10[CR]Main CPU : (2x) M6809 (@ 1.25 Mhz), Motorola M68705 (@ 1 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : M6802 (@ 921.6 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : Discrete[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 256 x 240 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 1024[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Even if title screen says 1982, Zoo Keeper was released in May 1983.[CR]Originally called "King Crab", Zoo Keeper was one of the few American-designed games that Taito released (with "Space Dungeon" and "Qix" being two others).[CR]Here's a story straight from John Morgan, one of the programmers : "In 1982, Keith Egging was the Director of Creativity (or some weird title like that). He always had a human skull on his desk which opened up on a hinge and was filled with Hershey's kisses. One day a TV news crew came over to do some interview, and Keith showed them around. He took them back into our area and really played it up (feed them some pretty thick bull which they really ate it up). He took them to the farthest office of cubicles and said that this was DEEP THOUGHT - where all the heaviest thinking took place. Of course this was just made up (the office being picked for it's distance only), but hey, they bought it. The main programmers (me, Mark Blazczyk and Rex Battenberg) took off on this and other of Keith's tall tales and frequently made up whoppers about everything under the sun to one up each other with our far fetched stories. Pretty cool for those days.[CR]Anyway, Keith came up with a weird game idea which I was going to program (back in those days there was only one programmer for pretty much all aspects of the entire game). His idea was to have a game where a crab would run around a rectangle on the screen. There were little eggs with faces on them that came out of the inside of the screen and would bounce off the rectangle and take bites out of it. When they went all the way through to the outside of the rectangle they would become tadpoles running around the rectangle edge. If the tadpole touched the crab it would be killed.[CR]The crab would move around the screen and jump over the tadpoles, with it's claws opening and closing. To repair the wall damage where the eggs bit off chunks of the wall, you pressed a button and a thick line would shoot across the screen from underneath the crab and away from it (horizontally or vertically as appropriate). We were going to use the sound of castanets when this line was fired out - he really loved that sound.[CR]This is about the stage where Keith's input finished, and the rest of the changes were almost entirely from my ideas.[CR]Now, as a side note, we had no way to get art into the games. So I wrote some software that would allow you to use a modified control panel (with more buttons) so that you could create art (pixel by pixel) on the screen itself, complete with animation control. We hired a part time animator to use it to design the animals, complete with great motion for the time.[CR]Secondly, we had to have sound effect and music. Tom Fosha (another programmer and a bit of a sick puppy in his own right) had been playing around with code to do some sound effects. Note that every sound sample was computer controlled (just like the graphics were). I looked at them and saw that they all either played with the volume of the samples (thus affecting the amplitude), or the duration in between the samples as they were output (thus affecting the frequency). I decided to write a single unified piece of code from scratch where you had two 24 byte buffers. One buffer held the volume levels for the looped sample (fairly traditional), and the second held the duration from each sample to the next (cutting a bit of new ground here). I then allowed each of these two waveforms to be independently controlled. You could smoothly morph a waveform from one to another (again pretty new for that time) or you could slowly add waveforms. You could avoid clipping of the signal (where a value is too positive and becomes negative etc.) or you could force it to occur (this had some really weird sounding effects). Since 24 samples is a multiple of 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, or 12, you could have samples which had different frequencies in the samples themselves. They made me a switchbox with 8 switches, so that I could try out code and use the switches to select among 16 voltage waveforms, and 16 frequency waveforms which combined with the particular controlling code I was trying. With trial and error, I came up with a zillion really weird sounds that I had never imagined. The ones I liked I kept, and that is where all of the sound effects came from in the game. They were all experimentally procedural.[CR]For the musical tunes, Tom Fosha wrote a separate multi-tone player, and composed the tunes himself which were used for all the melodies in the game. He was really into jazz, and that came over beautifully in the game. OK, back to the game. I wanted to somehow allow you to shoot out more walls to hold in the eggs. So I put little locks on the screen randomly. When you shot a line which hit a lock, it would shoot two lines out perpendicular to your line. If any of these lines hit another lock, you would get a cascade effect. When enough locks appeared it could be pretty cool visually. But the problem was that so many walls evenly distributed could trap the eggs near the outside of the rectangle (instead of the middle) and they'd just bounce &amp; eat their way out to the outside anyway.[CR]So then I made the distribution of the locks more towards the four corners. This tended to make solid walls around the outer edge, which helped, but you could still trap the eggs near the outside and they'd still escape. That's about the time when I said that seeing a big crab get killed by eggs which turned to little tadpoles was a bit goofy. I suggested that we change the crab to a person who ran around the rectangle and where he ran he would lay bricks which would fill from the outside in. The brick laying would stop if there was an enemy there so that there would be a clear space for it to return to the center.[CR]I suggested we change the eggs to animals which kept their form when they escaped, and would similarly kill the guy if he didn't jump over them. Since the guy was trying to keep the animals in then it seemed to make sense that he was a Zoo Keeper (I believe this was in a meeting with Ray Heidel, the Engineering Director). So we put a small cage in the center from which the animals escaped. I thought it would be cool to allow the Zoo Keeper to have a net which he used on the escaped animals which would put them back in the cage. And so I made the time line fuse which burned down, and along it were nets which would briefly give the Zoo Keeper this power. The actual art made the net look more like a frying pan (by accident), but that seemed pretty cool so I kept it and gave it an appropriate sound and effect when hitting the animals. I thought it'd be great to flash the entire screen for 1 frame when you did this. It had a pretty amazing subliminal effect on the excitement level.[CR]In the original version, when the animals escaped the rectangle they would randomly decide whether to run clockwise or counter clockwise. This made it hard to survive since you couldn't predict their behavior if they escaped near you, and having roughly half of the animals running each way made it pretty hard to survive for long by jumping over them. So I decided that when the animal escaped, it would run in the direction away from you (where you were at that time). This way they wouldn't escape near you and run into you, so you'd have a lot of warning before they got you.[CR]I made the reward for jumping over animals based on how many animals you jumped over. For each extra animal I roughly doubled the score. This continued for as many animals there were maximum in the game (16ish or so?, it's been a long time :-) So if you jumped a really massive number of animals you would get a gazillion points. But how do you get the animals to clump up for such a massive jump?[CR]That's when I decided to remove the initial bricks around the rectangle at the start of a level. I delayed the initial animals escaping the cage, to give you time to drop down and start laying the wall as you saw fit. The trick was to run in one direction and cover just slightly over 50% of the rectangle with a wall and then just stop. This would allow the animals to immediately escape, but they'd always run away from you which forced them to all go in the same direction. And since they were in the same direction it was easier to survive, and since different animals moved at different speeds, they would tend to clump together periodically so you could wait for that to happen and then jump over a huge number of animals in a single jump - and voila - you could get huge scores! [CR]Now, when the net came out, you would only want to knock in the animals that were running opposite to the direction of the herd. This you'd try to stand near a hole to force the escaping animals to run in the same direction as the herd. [CR]This pretty much completed the game play of the initial level. It was really fun, but I wanted to have something more to break up the monotony. So I came up with the idea of the ledge screen. You started at the bottom and could jump up on the moving ledges to get to your girl and save her. She was help captive by a gorilla throwing coconuts at you which would kill you (yeah, a bit of inspiration from Donkey Kong was going on here). I think it was Keith who came up with the name of Zeke and Zelda for the Zoo Keeper and his lady. I decided to make the ledges come out in a pre-determined sequence to reward the experienced player in that they would learn their preferred sequence of jumps to get safely to the top. This level was pretty cool, but I wondered what else I could do.[CR]So, I came up with the idea of the escalator screen (similar to the ledge screen but with a different game play layout). This time when Zeke got to the top Zelda would give him a kiss. [CR]Now you could cycle between these 3 levels for as long as a person could survive. If they made it far enough to loop back to levels they'd already done, I'd just speed things up a bit each time. Eventually they wouldn't be able to survive. For added coolness, I made the last escalator level so that when you saved Zelda a curtain would draw down over both of you, and a whole bunch of kisses would be all that appear. I wanted to make the kisses go up and down but we thought that would be a bit too much :-) [CR]Anyway, I got to be pretty good at the game and could survive longer and longer. I decided to add a visually frantic feel to the game at these levels by cycling the color of the outer background. This massive color cycling effect would slightly distort the screen image due to power blooming of the monitor. This really cranked up the adrenaline. I'd survive so long that I'd have the maximum number of animals out in almost the same direction and jumping almost all of them at once occasionally for some phenomenal score. This whole time I did this I was wrenching the joystick like I was going to break it off and the whole machine was rocking like the back seat in a drive in. I knew something was happening here.[CR]Then I survived so long that I came to a ledge screen where the ledges had disappeared completely. Seems I found a bug. But the thrown coconuts were bouncing off of them even though they were invisible. So I gave jumping a try. Remember that the ledge sequence was completely predictable and I had gotten quite familiar with it. So I actually had a chance of getting to the top. That's when I decided to not fix the bug, but make it a feature (I guess the old saying "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" really did apply here). We were ready to test the game. I put in the needed diagnostics so the operator could control it. Since speed of the game was key to how long people could play, I made two operator speed adjustments. The first controlled the speed when a person initially joined. The second controlled the speed when a person played for a long time. We put the machine out on test and I watched the players and timed them with a stopwatch. Then I tweaked these adjustments until they seemed optimal for fun and earnings.[CR]The game went out in 1983 and was about the number three game of the year nationwide, which was quite good. Unfortunately, this was right at the time when the whole arcade market took one huge dive, so the game only sold a fraction of what it would have if completed just a year earlier. As Keith said, "The cash box is a cruel mistress! It is indeed.".[CR]Shawn Cram holds the official record for this game with 21,849,650 points on June 15, 2003.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Early machines had a bug in which the player could turn the machine off and on and get one or two free credits.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]As time progresses, you can pick up items that will give you points. Among one of the items is a net. When you get the net, the background will turn blue for about seven seconds. Any animal you come in contact with will return to the cage. In round one, for example, where you have to tend to five elephants, the first three items are mugs of root beer, worth 120, 250, and 500 points; the net, the last item, scores 1,000 points. When time runs out, the stage is completed, and points are scored for every animal that is still inside the wall. The six animals, in order of ferocity :[CR]Elephant : 250 points.[CR]Snake : 500 points.[CR]Camel : 1,000 points.[CR]Rhinoceros : 2,000 points.[CR]Moose : 4,000 points.[CR]Lion : 30,000-70,000 points.[CR]When not tending to the wall, you can jump over the animals to score points :[CR]One animal : 100 points.[CR]Two animals : 500 points.[CR]Three animals : 2,000 points.[CR]Four animals : 6,000 points.[CR]Five animals : 15,000 points.[CR]Six animals : 30,000 points.[CR]Seven animals : 60,000 points.[CR]Eight animals : 120,000 points.[CR]Nine animals : 250,000 points.[CR]Ten animals : 500,000 points.[CR]Eleven animals : 1,000,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Zoo Keeper contains a little-known free game feature. You can go into option and set the 'Free Game Rate' to 99 to make it appear more frequently. If it's set to 0, it won't come out at all. The Zoo Keeper Flyer actually has a note saying that the free game feature maybe prohibited in some states! - The free game icon pops up on one of the platforms on the 3rd screen (coconuts). It comes out like one of the bonuses, but instead it says 'Free Game' in a little box. When it appears, it has it's own little tune too (and it usually pops up opposite of where you are, so if you are at the bottom of the screen, it will come out at the top).[CR]* Use A Benefit Free Try : Start the game, build the first wall of bricks a bit without jumping and immediately crash into an animal. If you have never jumped before, you won't lose a life. The game will simply advise you that you need to jump over animals to avoid them and round 1 will start again from its beginning. Best of all, you get to keep the wall of bricks that you built a bit. Of course, this being the first level, chances are you don't exactly need the extra help - but hey.[CR]* An Obscure Trick : On the coconut boards, when you jump onto the top ledge, you get some points. Jump off the ledge then onto it again; you'll get twice as many points. And again, for four times as many. The bonus keeps doubling until 300K per land. The best board to try this on is the board where the ledges are invisible. It's kind of hard to jump on then off, but so few coconuts are thrown that you have lots of room for error.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Designed by : John Morgan, Keith Egging[CR]Programmed by : John Morgan, Rex Battenberg, Mark Blazczyk[CR]Music and sound effects by : Tom Fosha[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Microsoft XBOX [EU] (October 14, 2005) "Taito Legends" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [EU] (October 14, 2005) "Taito Legends [Model SLES-53438]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [US] (October 25, 2005) "Taito Legends" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [US] (October 25, 2005) "Taito Legends [Model SLUS-21122]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [KO] (July 18, 2006) "Taito Legends [Model SLKA-15056]" [CR]* Computers : [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [EU] (October 14, 2005) "Taito Legends" [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [US] (November 10, 2005) "Taito Legends"[CR]</plot>

You should move down below a worm or wait for it to pass, and then move in to eat it from behind.[CR]* Spiders can only be killed by eating a Queen Ant. This will destroy all insects on the level, removing any imminent danger. Spiders move across the top tunnel of the screen until they reach the middle, and then walk down your tongue, until they reach the tip which causes you to lose a life.[CR]* Try to save eating the Queen Ants for as long as possible, until absolutely necessary to save you from a life-threatening situation.[CR]* Worms often appear at the same time as ants, and this will make killing them difficult. Also, you have to be careful the ants do not hit the tongue.

				<plot>Astro Blaster (c) 1981 Sega.[CR]Astro Blaster is a 1- or 2-player game in which players must advance through squadrons of alien ships in an attempt to dock with the mother ship. Players move their ship left or right and shoot at attacking squadrons. A special time warp allows the player to slow down the alien space ships and their laser fire, while maintaining his own ship and laser fire at normal speed.[CR]As players go through the game play, each step is directed by the voice of mission control. Mission control keeps players informed of fuel status, provides a countdown on warp, keeps track of the number of ships remaining, and monitors the player's laser temperature.[CR]As players enter each new sector they encounter a different number of alien squadrons. Players must destroy all ships in each squadron to pass through the sector. One squadron of rockets is extremely difficult to destroy, but players can pass through this squadron by hitting a few enemy ships. Once a player has destroyed all the squadrons in that sector, he enters an asteroid belt. He must maneuver and shoot his way through the asteroids to reach the mother ship. If fuel is critically low when the player enters the asteroid belt, he can receive extra fuel by shooting the red fireballs interspersed among the asteroids. After passing through the asteroid belt, the player's ship docks with the mother ship and refuels.[CR]There are 29 different alien squadrons players encounter as they move through the different sectors. Every new sector increases in difficulty with different numbers of squadrons in each sector. Each alien ship has its own individualized sounds, movements and firing capability.[CR]During their game, players must keep track of fuel consumption. As the player's ship moves through the sector, it consumes fuel. The player must ensure he has enough fuel to advance through the sector and dock with the mother ship. Extra fuel can only be obtained by shooting red fireballs or docking with the mother ship. The screen also displays the laser temperature. As players fire, the laser temperature rises. When they cease firing it cools down. If the laser overheats, players lose their laser fire until it cools down.[CR]By depressing the warp button, players slow down the enemy ships and their laser fire while maintaining his own at normal speed. Players receive one warp per ships and are awarded one warp upon docking, if he has used his warp in the previous sector.[CR]Each alien ship destroyed carries a different point value. Players also receive double points for destroying an alien ship when their fuel is in the red. To add further excitement, there are 25 tasks that a player performs during the course of the game and receives a secret bonus. Players do not know what these tasks are, but a good player will keep track. The 25 tasks are consistent throughout the game. Players also receive a bonus for any fuel they have left when they dock with the mother ship.[CR]With a two-player game, players alternate at the conclusion of each sector, not after each ship.  Players receive 3 to 5 ships, which is operator adjustable. The game is over when a player runs out of fuel, loses all his ships, or crashes while attempting to dock with the mother ship. The top three scores are displayed and the game ranks players from 1 to 99.[CR]PLAY INSTRUCTIONS :[CR]1. Shoot enemy space ships for points.[CR]2. Shoot fire balls for extra fuel.[CR]3. Use warp to slow down enemy ships and bombs (only once per sector or ship).[CR]4. Discover how to earn secret bonuses for extra points.[CR]5. Dock with mother ship to refuel after each sector.[CR]6. Game over when you run out of ships or fuel.[CR]7. Laser will not fire while overheated.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Sega G80 Raster hardware[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.867 Mhz), I8035 (@ 208 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : Discrete circuitry, SP0250 (@ 3.12 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Vertical[CR]Video resolution : 224 x 256 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 64[CR]Players : 2[CR]Buttons : 4 (LEFT, RIGHT, FIRE, WARP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Astro Blaster was released in March 1981.[CR]Astro Blaster was one of the big contributions from Sega/Gremlin. Utilizing speech synthesis, the game attracted players by stating 'Fighter pilots needed in sector wars, play Astro Blaster'. During game play, the game gave you different advice such as 'Alert, alert, invaders in sector 1, player 1 to battle stations', 'Fuel status marginal', or 'Warp activated, 10, 9, 8,...' to name a few.[CR]Astro Blaster wasn't the first game to introduce speech synthesis in a game, that honor goes to Taito's "Stratovox". Astro Blaster, though, challenged the player to go through seven sectors with a varying amount of waves within each sector. Astro Blaster was an extremely challenging game, it developed a solid following. It wasn't as popular as "Frogger", which was released later on, but it still had a solid showing and redefined how space shooters could be made more challenging. Other notable games released in this year were "Donkey Kong", "Galaga", "Vanguard", and "Wizard of Wor".[CR]The bonuses in this game were actually bugs that would appear if certain events took place. Rather than 'fix' the bugs, Gary Shannon changed them to bonus 'features'.[CR]Gus Pappas holds the official record for this game with 299,100 points on November 20, 1982.[CR]In Sega's Dreamcast 1999 video game "Shenmue", an Astro Blaster cabinet can be seen in the YOU Arcade in Dobuita, but it has an 'out of order' label on it and is not playable. Its possible it was originally playable and had to be removed for some reason, but it is perhaps there simply for the sake of realism; Shenmue is set in 1986/87, so even then it would be considered an old game.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Three versions of Astro Blaster were released. The first version was deemed too difficult to play. Version 2 was released to remedy this situation and to be a little more descriptive in the games instructions. Version 3 was basically the EASY version of Astro Blaster. All 3 versions had some things in common :[CR]1) All the different alien spacecraft were in all of the versions, it was just their order of appearance that made a difference.[CR]2) The secret bonuses were common to all three versions. Just because a sector had different waves didn't mean the bonuses for specific events were changed.[CR]3) Each had a high score table that held the 99 top scores.[CR]It was easy to spot a version one machine. The instructions were displayed on the screen. When you inserted your money, you just had to press the 1- or 2-player button to start the game.[CR]On versions 2 and 3, after you inserted your money, a blue screen came up and basically told you to press the 1- or 2-player button.. It also explained some of the rules while in attract mode. The order of the alien attackers is what determined version two and three.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]NOTE : During fuel status critical, everything in the game is double points.[CR]AMOEBAS : 70 Points[CR]BLUE&amp;RED DISCS : 70 Points[CR]BLUE&amp;RED SPIRALS : 110 Points[CR]BLUE&amp;RED TRIANGLE : 100 Points[CR]BLUE DIAMOND : 110 Points[CR]BLUE DISC : 60 Points[CR]BLUE OVALS : 120 Points[CR]BLUE HEXAGON : 110 Points[CR]BLUE UFO'S : 160/80 Points[CR]BLUE X's : 90 Points[CR]GALAXIANS : 70/110 Points[CR]GREEN DOUBLE ARROWS : 90 Points[CR]METEOR : 60 Points[CR]ORANGE&amp;PURPLE SPINNERS : 80/110 Points[CR]ORANGE ARROWS : 100 Points[CR]ORANGE CRYSTALS : 110 Points[CR]ORANGE DART : 40/70 Points[CR]ORANGE SAUCER : 50/100 Points[CR]RED-RINGED GLOBES : 100 Points[CR]RUBBER BANDS : 70 Points[CR]WHITE BLOCK : 70 Points[CR]WHITE BOATS : 90 Points[CR]WHITE SQUARES : 100 Points[CR]WHITE WINGS : 60 Points[CR]YELLOW BIRD : 70 Points[CR]YELLOW DOUBLE DIAMONDS : 80 Points[CR]You also get 100 points per asteroid you take out at the end of the sector.[CR]You also get a bonus for fuel remaining when you dock with the mother ship.[CR]You get a bonus for fuel remaining when you dock with the mother ship, awarded at 10 points per pixel of fuel.[CR]Secret Bonuses :[CR]Number 01, bonus 2,000 points.

Not dying during the sector (awarded before docking).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your star ship will be in the middle of the screen. The computer voice will state 'Alert, alert, invaders sector 1, player 1, battle stations'. With that, you are ready to rock and roll. Before you start your game, be sure of what version machine you are playing so you can get yourself prepared. Since each version alters the order of the aliens, it's not good to be prepared for one attack and a totally different attack comes along.[CR]* Although the computer voice can be annoying at times, it also gives you very valuable information. This will actually help you to concentrate more on destroying aliens then constantly looking at your gauges. Some helpful things the voice will tell you are :[CR]1) When your fuel status hits marginal and critical.[CR]2) When your laser temperature is approaching critical.[CR]3) The countdown after you activate warp.[CR]* Fuel is a very precious commodity in this game. If you run out of fuel, your game is over regardless of how many star ships you have left. Learn how to maximize your fuel usage because in the later sectors that have a lot of waves, you will be running on empty. Some other fuel facts :[CR]1) When you activate warp, only the enemies on the screen slow down. Your fuel supply continues to burn away in REAL time.[CR]2) When fuel status marginal is announced, you have approximately 25 seconds of fuel remaining.[CR]3) When fuel status critical is announced, you have approximately 8 seconds of fuel remaining.[CR]4) Shooting the fireballs in the asteroid wave will get you 3 more seconds of fuel.[CR]5) You score double points during fuel status critical.[CR]6) At the end of each sector, you will be re-fueled when you dock with the mothership.[CR]7) Losing a star ship doesn't replenish your fuel supply.[CR]* The warp button can be a blessing or a curse depending on how you use it. You only get one warp per sector or one per star ship. This works fine on the lower sectors that only have a few waves. On the higher sectors, though, you must plan (if possible) the best place to utilize it. Some tips :[CR]1) If it is used on an enemy that goes across the screen, wait until they are halfway across before activating the warp. This way, you can get them all before your warp time runs out.[CR]2) If used on the diagonal flying aliens, again, wait until a lot of them are out before activating.[CR]3) For other aliens, make sure they are mostly on the screen. Sometimes, these aliens disappear off screen and if you activated your warp too early, it will be wasted while they hang around outside of the playing area.[CR]* There are no safe places in this game so you must always be on the look out for not only the aliens dropping on you, but also their laser fire.[CR]* Speaking of laser fire, your ship is equipped with a powerful laser cannon.  There is no limit to the amount of shots you can fire, but there is a catch.  The cannon heats up with each shot fired. It will overheat if you fire too many shots too quickly, and you will have to wait about eight seconds for it to cool off before you can fire it again. Some ways to prevent overheating :[CR]1) Make your shots count. Don't hold down the fire button to take out the aliens. Shoot to kill, not to warn.[CR]2) If you must do multiple shots, do it in short bursts. Your laser heats up much faster then it cools down.[CR]3) If you do overheat, just avoid the aliens and their fire until your laser is operational again.[CR]* Docking is the easiest way to get a lot of points. You need to set yourself up after the last of the asteroids in order to get those points. Moving your ship during docking procedures will prevent you from getting any docking bonus. The most points are from the 'Paint Scraper' method : Line up your left engine over the C in SECTOR. It will look like you will collide with the left docking arm but you will barely squeeze by. Thus, you now have 1,500 points.[CR]* Also, if you destroy your star ship during docking, your game will be over regardless of the number of men you have left.[CR]* Always expect the unexpected in this game. Sometimes the aliens will do things or make moves you haven't seen before. The best way to counter this is to always be on guard.[CR]* After sector seven, the sectors repeat again. Also, the score 'rolls over' at 99,990. Many players will intentionally get themselves killed when they get close to this score in order to claim the number one position on the board.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Designed &amp; programmed by : Gary Shannon, Barbara Michalec[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Handhelds : [CR]Sony PSP [US] (November 16, 2006) as an unlockable extra in "Sega Genesis Collection [Model ULUS-10192]" [CR]Sony PSP [EU] (February 2, 2007) as an unlockable extra in "Sega Mega Drive Collection [Model ULES-00556]" [CR]Sony PSP [AU] (February 8, 2007) as an unlockable extra in "Sega Mega Drive Collection [Model ULES-00556]"[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Bagman (c) 1982 Valadon Automation [VA].[CR]The objective of the game is to maneuver Bagman through various mine shafts, picking up money bags and placing them in a wheelbarrow at the surface of the mine. The player must avoid pursuing guards, moving ore carts, and descending elevators. The player may temporarily stun the guards by striking them with a pickaxe or by dropping money bags on them when they are below the player on the same ladder. The player may move between the three screens which make up the level via shafts and on the surface.[CR]Bagman is played using one 4-way joystick and one action button. The joystick is also used to jump out of the ore cart. The Action Button is used to make the Bagman perform the following tasks:[CR]Pick up and drop money bags[CR]Pick up and drop pickaxe[CR]Grab and release the ceiling beam to avoid the ore cart (this can be done while carrying a money bag)[CR]Placing a money bag in the wheelbarrow[CR]Pick up and drop the wheelbarrow[CR]Points are scored for each horizontal step the player takes, for each money bag placed in the wheelbarrow, and for each guard stunned.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips: General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.5 Mhz), TMS5110 (@ 640 Khz) [speech][CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 4-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Bagman was released in January 1982.[CR]Also licensed to Stern for US distribution (same month).

For more information on the game itself, please see the original release entry.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 500 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (PEPPER)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Burger Time was released in November 1982. The game was originally titled "Hamburger" in Japan, but was renamed "Burger Time" before being exported internationally. [CR]The game was originally made for the DECO Cassette System, an early arcade format that pulled the game data from audio cassettes. The cassette system enjoyed a brief bit of popularity, until it was discovered that the cassettes quickly wore out, rendering the game useless. Bally/Midway licensed this title soon after its original release (October 1982), and redesigned the hardware to drop the cassette altogether. The Bally/Midway version of the game sold vast quantities when compared to the original.[CR]This stand-alone version, manufactured without Bally/Midway's involvement, features a different attract mode.[CR]When starting a new game (and a new life after getting caught), the game start display says 'Game Ready'. This was corrected to 'Get Ready' in the Bally/Midway version. It originally said 'Game Start' in "Hamburger".[CR]When the chef runs out of pepper, the 'Pepper' display blinks, but there is no warning sound.[CR]In the Data East USA version : [CR]* Gameplay is noticeably much faster than the other versions.[CR]* 'Lives' dip switch can be set to 30,000, 50,000, 80,000, or None.[CR]* The attract mode is exactly the same as the Bally/Midway version except for the different copyright information on the title screen.[CR]Bryan Wagner holds the official record for this game with 11,512,500 points on September 19, 2008.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Stage 1[CR]The introductory stage is very spacious and balanced, and you will only have to contend with three copies of Mr. Hot Dog and one copy of Mr. Egg. No one section of the stage presents any danger since ample escape routes can be found. At most, the burger layers only need to drop through five floors, so this stage won't take you as long as some of the other stages. Use this stage to understand the nature of the enemies' movement. Note how they tend to alternate between walking across a floor and using a ladder whenever they encounter one or the other that brings them closer to your position. Setting up the layers to allow enemies to drop with them is fairly easy to do.[CR]Stage 2[CR]While this stage features the same number of enemies as the previous stage, the layout of the floors makes the top portion of the screen much safer than the bottom portion. With the limited space and choices in the lower half of the stage, it is best to save it for last when you have no choice but to clear it. Focus on getting to the top as quickly as possible, but watch out for where the enemies are appearing. Staying on a ladder for a little while is a great way to lure enemies to a lower floor than the one you intend to visit. Once the two side burgers are complete, you must venture down the center of the stage. Before you do, draw the enemies as high as possible before heading down the center. Once you're ready to clear the stage, try to lure an enemy on to a top bun before dropping it. If you time it well, the enemies can clear the stage for you faster than you could. Note that the lower floors where the burgers wait are dead ends.[CR]Stage 3[CR]Even though you must build six burgers with only three layers each, this stage is a lot tougher than it looks. This time, six enemies will pursue you, including the never-before-seen Mr. Pickle. First and foremost, you need to get out of the bottom portion of the stage as quickly as possible. And the left is not a good choice for escape routes. If the copy of Mr. Pickle that enters from that side doesn't get you, another enemy is almost sure to come down that left ladder and trap you. Instead, head immediately for the right. If you're an expert player, you may choose to complete that lower right hamburger before continuing on to the top, but the more time you spend there, the bigger opportunity you give the enemies to trap you. Beginners should climb the right side of the stage all the way to the top in order to gain a little control over the enemies' movements. Like the previous stage, focus on completing the burgers at the top before tackling the lower burgers on either side.[CR]Stage 4[CR]You may feel a little daunted by the task at hand when you first see this stage: four hamburgers composed of eight layers. That's a lot of walking. But if you remember to focus your efforts on the top buns as much as possible, you won't waste a lot of time. The ladders are arranged in such a way that continuous climbing is difficult to accomplish. Instead, you and the enemies are more likely to staircase your way through the stage in order to get around. This can be a blessing and a curse. It's good because the enemies have few direct paths or multiple options to attack you from. It's bad because you need to become very skilled at controlling Peter in order not to slow down as you progress up or down the screen. Peter can feel very sluggish on ladders, and it can be difficult at first to properly time his transitions from ladder to floor and back to ladder again. By the time you complete this stage however, you'll have plenty of practice.[CR]Stage 5[CR]If you think that this stage is easier than the last stage because there's only half as many burgers to make, you're wrong. The layout of the stage is such that you have very few options to get from one section to another. Fewer options to move means fewer chances to escape so you must plot your course through this stage very carefully in order to avoid the six enemies that will be occupying the stage with you. There are two strategies to take. One involves luring the enemies to the lower right hand portion of the stage to keep them occupied for a while. This can be risky however, since you might become trapped from above and below. The other strategy is to employ pepper more liberally, provided you have a good supply by this stage. If you intend to use pepper, and wish to make the most use out of it, be sure to freeze enemies while they are standing on top of a layer so that you can walk across the layer and send it falling several stories with the enemy on board.[CR]Stage 6[CR]This is the last new stage that you will see before the game repeats the cycle of stages over again. In the heat of the moment, it's very easy to assume that certain paths on this stage connect when in fact they don't. Total comprehension of your available escape routes will decrease your chances of getting trapped and increase your chances of survival. The burgers on the side are especially dangerous since every layer is perched on a dead end. If an enemy is following you, it's relatively easy to drop a burger layer with the enemy standing on it, but getting out of the area can be tricky if you are too slow and allow another enemy to pursue you. You'll need to employ every trick that you've learned in the previous five stages to make it out of this one. The most important thing is not to panic.[CR]Beyond Stage 28[CR]The game will continue normally until stage 28. Starting on stage 28 the enemies move about 2 1/2 times faster than they did before. After 90 seconds (if you can survive that long on one chef), they slow down to a crawl, moving one step every 5 seconds. You can still die if you run into the enemies. The chefs speed never changes. If you can make it to the top of the board (28), you can find the "safe" spot. You can hide out here until they slow down. You will need new patterns for each board to group the enemies, and wait each time for each drop. It can take 1-1 1/2 hour per board at this level.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]NOTE: Only ports released outside Japan and North America are listed here.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Carnival</title_clean>
				<plot>Carnival (c) 1980 Gremlin/Sega Ind., Incorporated.[CR]CARNIVAL is a 1 or 2 player alternate action game that simulates a carnival shooting gallery. The playfield consists of three target rows, a rotating pipe wheel, a bonus message panel, and a 'special' target block.[CR]The player uses a left right control to position a rifle at the bottom of the screen, and a shoot control to fire the rifle. Two rows of bullets at the bottom of the screen indicate the number of shots remaining to the player. Every time the player shoots, one of the bullets disappears from the screen. More bullets are given during the first round than the others, so, the inexperienced player will have a chance to enjoy the play.[CR]The game ends when the player runs out of bullets. This can occur on any round. A round ends when the player clears the playfield of all targets. At this point, a special 'shoot the bear' sequence appears, and when this is finished the player proceeds to the next more difficult (and higher scoring) round. This is Gremlin's Multi-Phase design concept that keeps games challenging to players of all levels.[CR]When a player completes a round (ending with 'shoot the bear' sequence), the screen flips to the other player. When the original player resumes play, he advances to the next level of difficulty, exactly as he would have if the screen had not flipped to the other player. This method allows the players to more directly compare their scores, since they are always within one round of each other. Note that the player who ends the game first does not necessarily lose--he might still have the higher score when the game ends.[CR]The three target rows move in a horizontal line from left to right (top row), right to left (middle row) and left to right (bottom row). There are five types of targets. The rows move as a continuous band--the targets exiting the playfield from the right side of the bottom row reappear at the left of the top row. The point value for hitting a row target is indicated along the right side of the game--maximum points for a top row target, medium points for a middle row target, and minimum points for a bottom row target. These values increase from round to round.[CR]Rabbits and owls are simple targets, which disappear when hit.[CR]Numbered sign targets award additional bullets to the player when hit, as well as awarding the points indicated for the row. These targets appear only on the top two rows to make them relatively difficult targets.[CR]Five small letters, B, 0, N, U and S are randomly interspersed through the target rows. At the upper right of the playfield is the word ''bonus" spelled out is small letters. If the player manages to hit the moving bonus letters in order (b-o-n-u-s) a special bonus is awarded. The fact that the bonus is still active is shown by the bonus word in the upper right of the playfield. Every time a bonus letter in the correct order is hit, the small corresponding letter in the bonus panel enlarges to show that it has been hit. Whenever a bonus letter is hit out of order, the bonus panel disappears until the next round. The bonus panel reappears at the beginning of every round. The bonus value is determined by adding row target points into the bonus value. When the "B" letter is hit, the bonus value freezes for that round. This encourages waiting as long as possible before attempting to score the bonus.[CR]Ducks are special targets. Whenever a duck reaches the bottom row, it is capable of leaving the row and flying down toward the player. If the duck manages to get past the player's rifle without being shot, it flies down to the bullet row and quickly eats 10 bullets. A maximum of three ducks can escape simultaneously.[CR]The target rows move as a continuous band of targets, and no new owls, rabbits, or bonus letter targets are added once the round starts. 'More shots' targets and ducks are added during a round. The frequency of adding duck targets is tied to the round number. As the rounds get more difficult, more ducks are added as the round progresses.[CR]A flying duck hit scores no points.[CR]Bullets left over at the end of a round earn 50 points each.[CR]The between rounds 'shoot the bear' sequence operates as a shooting gallery bear. Whenever the bear is hit, it rears up, roars, and continues motion in the opposite direction. Each hit speeds up the bear, and increases the point value, which is shown above the bear for each hit. When the bear leaves the screen (which it will always do eventually, since it speeds up with each hit) the between rounds sequence ends and a new round begins. As the rounds progress, more bears (a maximum of 4) appear on the screen simultaneously.[CR]A special yellow-rimmed score panel appears in the upper left of the playfield, and stays on for random lengths of time. Four types of panels appear here, which either add or subtract points or bullets. Hitting any part of the panel border awards the score shown inside.[CR]The bullet bonus panel is shown with a large plus sign, and a row of bullets. Immediately after appearing, the bullets begin disappearing fairly rapidly. When the bullets are depleted, the panel disappears. If hit, the player is awarded the number of bullets left in the panel when it was hit.[CR]The score bonus is shown with the same large plus sign, and a score value. As with the bullets, the score value quickly decreases, until it hits zero and disappears.[CR]The minus panels are similar to those above except a large minus sign indicates the number of bullets or points subtracted when hit. This discourages the practice of parking on the left margin and shooting--a miss will hit the negative target. These panels show a fixed number of bullets or points, and after a random time interval, disappear.[CR]The pipe wheel contains 8 pipes of 4 different colors. A panel beneath the wheel restricts pipe hits to horizontally oriented pipes, and also indicates the point value for hitting a pipe. Every shot the player takes decrements the pipe value, except a shot which hits a pipe. This makes it advisable to hit pipes early in the round, when it is most difficult (since the player must shoot through heavily populated target rows). Hitting two pipes of the same color with two consecutive shots awards a bonus of four times the pipe value shown in the panel.[CR]CARNIVAL is accompanied by background music. At the beginning of every round, the music begins at a slow rate and relatively low key. As the round progresses, the music speeds up and the melody shifts up in key. This gives the player a growing sense of urgency. As the round progresses, the playfield motion also gradually speeds up.[CR]A small panel on the right of the playfield contains a musical note symbol. If the player wishes to turn off the music, he simply shoots the note panel. This makes the note disappear, and turns off the music. Hitting the panel again makes the note reappear and resumes the music. The note thus acts as a 'flip-flop' switch to turn the music on and off.[CR]Every round begins with the music on.[CR]There is a special case to consider near the end of a round: the player has cleared all of the targets except the ducks, and has plenty of bullets left so that he can simply sit and wait for the ducks. He would, in effect, prolong the game by refusing to end the round.[CR]Theoretically, by hitting the ducks and 'more shots' signs, the round could be prolonged indefinitely. However, an internal "doomsday" timer in the game keeps track of how long a round has lasted. After a certain time limit (the same for each round), the frequency of new duck appearances increases dramatically.[CR]The top 3 scores are shown during advertising, along with the player's initials. A player who scores in the top 3 is allowed to enter 3 initials by a special routine explained at the time of their writing. The rank is updated during the round. The player is both audibly and visually rewarded. There is a pronounced audible sound as the player's score passes that of another ranking player's score. And, they may watch their rank progress during the game.[CR]CARNIVAL's basic play action is outlined below, as it appears in the game instructions.[CR]Shoot all targets and pipes to advance to the next round.[CR]Game is over when you run out of bullets.[CR]Escaped ducks eat 10 bullets.[CR]Hit B-O-N-U-S letters in sequence for special bonus. Bonus value stops increasing when 'B' is hit.[CR]Hit same color pipes with 2 consecutive shots to score 4 times pipe value. Shoot number signs for more bullets.[CR]Shoot the bear between rounds for extra points.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model][CR]There were 2 different upright cabinets available for this game. The first upright was the standard Sega/Gremlin woodgrain cabinet. The second was a white cabinet.[CR]The upright machines were decorated in mostly orange, with a circus theme. The woodgrain ones often did not have sideart, but the white ones usually did. Both versions used buttons on the control panel for movement.[CR]Game ID : 651-666[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.93356 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : I8039 (@ 238.636 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.193181 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Vertical[CR]Video resolution : 224 x 256 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 64[CR]Players : 1[CR]Buttons : 5[CR]Player-1 start, Player-2 start, Move Left, Move Right, Fire[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released during June 1980.[CR]Also released as "Carnival [Cocktail model]".[CR]CARNIVAL contains the following sounds :[CR]A clang sound every time a row target or bear is hit;[CR]A pipe hit sound whenever a pipe is hit;[CR]A bear roar whenever the bear is hit and rears up;[CR]Three different duck quack sounds, to accompany up to three simultaneously escaped ducks;[CR]A bonus sound for lighting the BONUS letters in the correct order;[CR]A secondary bonus sound for pipe bonus and special panel bonus;[CR]A rank sound as the player's score moves up in rank;[CR]Background music; [CR]Rifle shot.[CR]Fred Pastore holds the official record for this game with 386,750 points on June 3, 2001.[CR]A Carnival unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Shooting the bonus box at the top left: the score inside the box (+ or -).[CR]Shooting an object in the top row scores the points at the right of the screen level with the top row (50, 60, etc).[CR]A hit in the 2nd row scores the points at the right of the screen level with the 2nd row (30, 40, etc).[CR]A hit in the bottom row scores the points at the right of the screen level with the bottom row (10, 20, etc).[CR]A hit on a polar bear in the intermission screen scores 50 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Make any ducks on the lowest level your priority at the start of a screen, as they will soon swoop down to steal some of your ammunition.[CR]* Keep an eye out for the passing boxed '5' and '10' symbols, as these award 5 or 10 extra bullets respectively when shot. You won't have enough ammo to complete a screen without at least hitting a few of these.[CR]* You can stay to the left of the screen, which will enable you to pick off any good bonuses in the bonus box at an early stage. Don't get too trigger happy though, or you might be dropping your score or losing a lot of ammo too quickly if you hit a negative 'bonus'.[CR]* The key to getting a lot of hits on the polar bear(s) in the bonus stage is to concentrate on only one bear and hit it as close to dead centre as possible. If you do this keep firing rapidly and you'll rack up a few points as it won't be able to escape from a constant barrage of bullets.[CR]* Extra bullet '5' and '10's only appear on the top two rows and don't reappear at the top after going offscreen from the middle row so make sure you pick them off whenever possible.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Lead Programmer : Medo Moreno[CR]Programmer : Helene Schlein[CR]Programmer : Murphy Bivens[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Colecovision (1982)[CR]Mattel Intellivision (1982)[CR]Atari 2600 (1982)[CR]* Computers :[CR]Sinclair ZX-Spectrum (1984, "Carnival", Eclipse Software)[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Centipede (c) 1980 Atari.[CR]Centipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan monitor. The fast-moving game action takes place on a magical mushroom patch and includes a variety of insects that drop down from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the Bug Blaster, controlled by the player. The Bug Blaster is represented on the screen by a somewhat humanoid head. The object of the game is to shoot at and destroy as many of these insects and mushrooms as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up. [CR]Player control consists of a Mini-Trak Ball control and a FIRE button. The Bug Blaster is moved by rotating the Midi-Trak Ball control. The Bug Blaster can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom 5th of the screen. However, the Bug Blaster must move around mushrooms, since these are fixed, not 'transparent', objects. Pressing the button causes the Bug Blaster to fire individual shots upward, either singly or in rapid-fire mode, if held down constantly. (Only one shot appears on the screen at a time.) [CR]Game play begins with a playfield of randomly-placed mushrooms in a mushroom patch. A Centipede starts snaking its way across from the center top of the screen. The Centipede changes direction when it runs into a mushroom or either the left or right boundaries of the playfield. [CR]When a segment of the Centipede is shot, it is destroyed and a mushroom appears where that segment was shot. When a body segment is shot, the Centipede breaks into two smaller Centipedes, each with its own head. When a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts back up, but remains within the area of the Bug Blaster (the bottom fifth of the screen). [CR]If a Centipede reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot, it releases its tail. This tail changes into a new head. Also to provide the player a challenge, if a Centipede is still alive when it reaches the bottom, new heads will enter the screen almost at the bottom of the sides. More of these heads will appear as time progresses. [CR]A round of play ends when all Centipede segments are destroyed. [CR]The randomly moving Spiders also appear in the first wave. The Spiders can destroy any mushrooms they move over. This eliminates many mushroom targets for a player. Depending on a special option switch setting, the Spider moves slowly until the player reaches a specific score, and then it speeds up. If the Bug Blaster and a Spider collide, both are destroyed. [CR]Whan a Centipede with fewer than eleven body segments appears, a bombardment of Fleas starts. As a Flea descends, it leaves a trail of new mushrooms behind it. Fleas appear when a certain number of mushrooms remains at the bottom of the screen. This number increases as the game progresses, meaning Fleas appear more often later on in the game. The Bug Blaster must hit a Flea twice to destroy it; the first shot just speeds it up. [CR]When a Centipede with fewer than ten body segments appears, a Scorpion enters from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Scorpion's speed increases. [CR]As the Scorpion travels across the screen, it 'poisons' the mushrooms that it moves over and changes their colors. These mushrooms cause any Centipedes that would collide with them to head straight towards the bottom of the screen, rather than continue snaking around. The Bug Blaster can stop a poisoned Centipede by shooting its head. [CR]In addition, these poisoned mushrooms as well as any partially shot mushrooms add 5 points to the player's score as the mushroom patch resets after a player loses a life. [CR]If the players are very skilled and earn at least 60,000 points, two things happen to increase player challenge : the Fleas descend at a faster speed and the Spiders restrict their movement to a smaller area at the bottom of the screen. [CR]An important new feature of this game is the operator option for easy/hard game difficulty. At Easy, the Spider moves slowly up to a 5,000-point score, and then bounces at a higher speed. It also changes direction less often throughout the game than at the hard setting. At Hard, the Spider moves slowly only for the first 1,000 points, and then speeds up. It also changes direction more often throughout the game. In either setting, the Spider always moves at a 45-degree angle or straight up and down.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 136001 [CR]The upright models were by far the most common. All of them can be converted to "Millipede" with only minor effort. They all have control panels with a trackball, although the upright version uses a larger ball than the other ones do. All of the trackballs are prone to wear and tear, but replacement parts are readily available. The upright was in a white cabinet that was similar in construction to the Asteroids cabinet. The game featured ornate painted side-art of a truly evil looking green bug, while the monitor bezel and marquee basically copied the same picture, but from a different angle. [CR]Height: 71 in. (180.34 cm) [CR]Width: 26.75 in. (67.95 cm) [CR]Depth: 25.25 in. (64.14 cm) [CR]Main CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 1.512 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : POKEY (@ 1.512 Mhz) [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : trackball [CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]The original Upright model of Centipede was released in June 1981, and was sold $1,995 at its release. 46,062 units were produced. It's Atari's second bestselling coin-op game. [CR]It was an Atari coin-operated game that swiftly won a wide following in the arcades. Apart from its smooth game play, Centipede was praised for its refreshing approach to screen colors and for its whimsical mushroom world. [CR]Centipede was the first coin-op game to be designed by a woman - Dona Bailey. But Ed Logg did the majority of the work on Centipede; Dona only came up with the prototype idea, where the mushrooms were indestructible and it was more like "Space Invaders". Like "Pac-Man", this game has special appeal to women. [CR]* The Creation of Centipede : Centipede was written by veteran Atari designer Ed Logg, who has become something of a legend in the world of video games, and a young game programmer who was credited with bringing a gentler touch to the world of video games with the enchanted mushroom patch. [CR]Steve Calfee : 'Ed Logg is the world's greatest games designer. He's done the most, the best games. His line up starts with "Asteroids", which probably still is the biggest run we ever did. He's in [a long line of games]. He's kind of like Pete Rose; he has the most hits and he's also probably got the most strike outs. He just goes up to bat.' [CR]* Remembrances from the Video Game Masters : The mushroom patch with its tenacious, never-say-die centipedes, bouncing spiders, mushroom-laying fleas and transforming scorpions provided an imaginative leap for players, just as did the hoards of aliens in "Tempest", the outer space adventures of "Asteroids", the eerie battlefields of "Battlezone" and even the frightful scenarios of "Missile Command". Of these times, and the games that emerged from Atari, Rich Adam said : 'We were a young group of fun people who were sort of treading on untrodden territory. We were out exploring what technology could do to entertain adolescent minds, and we were adolescent minds.' [CR]In the early days of personal computers, before they became commonplace, and before sophisticated gaming programs were available for them, the arcades (and wherever else the coin-operated games were located) were the portals into these new fantasy worlds. And a river of quarters carried players into the electronic realms. Dan Pliskin described the coin-operated video game business as follows : "It was a wacky, extremely competitive business. I was there when coin-operated games were earning $8 billion in quarters a year. These games were out-grossing the record industry and the movie industry combined, in quarters! And when you looked at who was manufacturing these games, it was just a couple of Japanese companies and a few American companies.... There was incredible competition, all for kids' lunch and church money!" [CR]The quarters are still rolling in. Dan Plishkin continued : "People say that video games have already seen their heyday and business has definitely gone downhill. Maybe it has gone downhill. Maybe it's only $4 billion worth of quarters now. It's still one heck of an industry." [CR]* Popular from the Start : The prototype games were hand-built, wire-wrapped, one-of-a kinds that were created by the development team prior to ordering the circuit boards for the mass-produced versions. With just a single machine, people would come in at all hours of the night to play a new game. [CR]Dan Plishkin : 'One of the things that kind of allowed everybody at Atari to have kind of a loose and enjoyable relationship was that management was kind of loose, too. An example of that happened with one of Howard Delman's games. I can't remember which one it was, but we sent the one and only prototype wire-wrapped version of Howie's game off to the AMOA (Amusement and Music Operators Association) show with strict orders not to sell it.' [CR]Of course the game was sold anyway, and a new prototype had to be assembled back at the labs. Dan Plishkin continued : 'Several months later Howie gets a call from the person who bought this game. It had stopped collecting money and he wanted to know how to change the settings to make it play longer, or something, to see if it would earn more money. Howie had to tell the guy that if it ever collected any money at all, it was a miracle because it didn't have any coin routines at all. It had none, because we had wired it for free-play when we sent it to the AMOA show!' [CR]* The Great 25-Cent Escape : Especially in the early 1980s a great many newspaper and magazine articles were written about the meaning of and possible consequences of the wave of video games that seemed to allure so many kids, and adults, to the arcades. But at the heart of it might have been the promise of a quick escape into another world. [CR]Rich Adam : "I kind of figured out, maybe years after the fact, what I think the lure of video games is. It's because people have so little control over their lives. This is especially true with kids, but even adults often have little control over the day-to-day part of their lives. You have to go to work. You don't get to control that much of your life. But for a quarter you can control this very complex machine. You can command it. For a quarter that's quite a bargain, to be able to do that for five minutes... When you're good at a game it gives you an incredible sense of power over the whole environment.". [CR]Centipede was the 1st UL (Underwriter's Laboratories) approved game. [CR]Jim Schneider holds the official record for this game on 'Marathon' settings with 16,389,547 points on August 1, 1984. [CR]Donald Hayes holds the official record for this game on 'Tournament' settings with 7,111,111 points on November 5, 2000. [CR]Note 1 : The upright side artwork features a grasshopper, while it is not present during game-play. In test mode you can cycle through the different graphical objects used in the game (the player, a mushroom, a spider, a scorpion, a flea and a grasshopper). Grasshopper?! Yes, the game was to originally have had grasshoppers but they were taken out. You can still see them in the test however. [CR]Note 2 : 'Centipede' is also the name of a terrifying, man-eating monster of the size of a mountain. This Japanese legend say that the dragon king of that particular lake asked the famous hero Hidesato to kill it for him. The hero slew it by shooting an arrow, dipped in his own saliva, into the brain of the monster. The dragon king rewarded Hidesato by giving him a rice-bag; a bag of rice which could not be emptied and it fed his family for centuries. [CR]Centipede inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Ode To A Centipede' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. [CR]The default high score screen of "Cyberball 2072" features names of many Atari arcade games, including CENTIPED. [CR]A Centipede unit appears in the 1982 movie "Fast Times at Ridgemont High", in the 1983 movie "WarGames", in the 1983 movie "James Bond 007 - Never Say Never Again", in the 1983 movie "Joysticks", in the 1984 movie "Body Double", in the 1985 movie "Teen Wolf", in the 1986 movie "Running Scared", in the 1987 movie "Death Wish 4 - The Crackdown", in the 1995 movie "Species" and in the 1996 movie 'House Arrest'. [CR]In 1982, Atari released a set of twelve collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battle Zone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight". [CR]MB (Milton Bradley) released a boardgame based on Atari's Centipede. [CR]A Reimagined version of the Centipede franchise, was launched for the Nintendo 3DS and Nintendo Wii under name of "Centipede Infestation".[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Mushrooms &amp; Poisoned Mushrooms : 1 point (Takes four hits to destroy) [CR]Centipede (Body) : 10 points [CR]Centipede (Head) : 100 points [CR]Flea : 200 points (Takes two hits. First hit speeds it up, second hit destroys it) [CR]Spider : 300, 600, 900 points (Points increase the closer the Spider is to the Bug Blaster when hit) [CR]Scorpion : 1,000 points [CR]When the mushroom patch is reset after a player loses a life, each partially destroyed/poisoned mushroom that is restored awards the player 5 bonus points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, you will be put in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You have an area five mushrooms high (about 20% of the playing area) to maneuver your Bug Blaster in. The game will start when the enemies enter the screen. Know your enemies! This is the single most important aspect of this game. If you don't know how each of the enemies behave, you won't last long. The enemies are : [CR]1) Centipede (Body and Head) : Goes back and forth across the screen. Will drop to the next level when it encounters a mushroom or the side of the game field. It will go all the way to the bottom when it hits a poisoned mushroom. [CR]2) Spider : These appear from the top left or right of the player area. They will either bounce across the player's area at 45-degree angles or bounce in at a 45-degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, go to the middle at a 45-degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, then finally go to the right side (at a 45-degree angle), bounce up and down, then exit the area. They destroy mushrooms they cross over. [CR]3) Flea : These appear in Wave 2. They will appear when you have cleared out most of the mushrooms in the player area.[CR]4) Scorpion : These appear in Wave 3. They go across the screen and poison all the mushrooms in their path. [CR]* The Centipede will start out as a head and eleven body segments on Wave 1. Wave 2 will be a head with ten body segments and a head that enters from the opposite side. Wave 3 will be a head with nine body segments and two heads that enter from opposite sides. This progression keeps going until Wave 12 when all that enter the screen are heads. The progression then starts back up again in a never ending cycle. [CR]* You must eliminate the Wave 1 Centipede only once. Then, until you score reaches 40,000 points, you must destroy each subsequent Centipede wave twice--first as the Centipede moves slowly towards you, then as it moves fast. After your score reaches 40,000 points, each Centipede will only need to be destroyed once. [CR]* Shooting the Centipede can have two effects : [CR]1) If you shoot the head, that part turns into a mushroom and the next segment becomes the new head and the Centipede will travel in the opposite direction (since it hit the newly-created mushroom). [CR]2) If you shoot the middle of the body, then the segment hit will become a mushroom. The old Centipede will continue in the same direction. The new Centipede will develop a head at the next segment after the break and head off in the opposite direction. [CR]* A good strategy to ensure you destroy the Centipedes in one stroke and to keep the Fleas at bay is to create 'mushroom corridors'. Mushroom corridors are basically corridors between two rows of mushrooms where you can funnel the Centipede down and destroy it when it is moving head-first at your Bug Blaster. [CR]* A good defense against the Flea is to keep a certain amount of mushrooms on the screen. There is no hard set value but when the Fleas don't come down, you have enough. This number gets higher as your score increases. [CR]* Speaking of score, Fleas start traveling faster after 60,000 points. [CR]* Watch out for the Spiders. They enter at either the top or bottom corners. Your Bug Blaster may be in the way if this happens. In addition to collisions, the Spiders wipe out all mushrooms that are in its path. This can create problems when you are creating mushroom corridors. It can also cause the Fleas to appear since you won't have many mushrooms in the player area. [CR]* Spiders are unpredictable, so be careful. Sometimes they pounce using long, high leaps and sometimes it bounces in a series of short jumps. Aim your shots and plan your moves based on where the Spider is, and not where you think it is going.[CR]* Remember that Spiders never turn back. Once one passes your Bug Blaster on its journey from one side of the mushroom patch to the next, you can ignore it. If the Spider emerges from the right side of the screen, it will work its way toward the left side of the screen, and vice versa. It may pause along its way to bounce straight up and down, but it will never reverse direction.[CR]* Blast the Fleas! They are relatively easy to pick off, especially once you get good at moving your Bug Blaster smoothly across the bottom of the screen. Be careful, though! It takes two shots to kill a Flea and after the first hit the falling speed increases.[CR]* Blast the Fleas as soon as you can. Stop them from laying mushrooms because you'll just have to blast them out of the way later. The more mushroom on the screen (especially in the player area), the more quickly the Centipedes work their way to the bottom. [CR]* If you don't like Fleas, always leave five mushrooms in your area (out of your line of fire). Fleas stop falling when there are five or more mushrooms in the player area. But be on the lookout for Spiders. They destroy mushrooms and if the count drops below five, the Fleas start falling again.[CR]* Keep track of where the Scorpions move across the screen. As soon as the Centipede hits a poisoned mushroom, it will immediately head for the bottom of the screen. The only way to stop this headlong plunge is to shoot it in the head. In the later waves, it is not uncommon to have multiple Scorpions going across the screen. They also provide the most points in the game, but they are hard to get. Often rows of mushrooms protect them. [CR]* Play the cycles. As the waves progress and more Centipede segments are entering the mushroom patch as independent heads, put more effort into blasting the heads than into chasing Fleas and Spiders. If your area gets too crowded with Centipede heads, you'll have to move your Bug Blaster with exceptional speed and smoothness to stay alive.[CR]* If you get unlucky and let the Centipede into your area, you need to destroy it before it gets to the bottom of the player area. Once it reaches the bottom, it will ascend (it will never leave the player area, though). If it does reach the bottom of the player area, another head will come out from the opposite side to start its back and forth march across the screen. This will continue until you destroy all the Centipede parts in the player area or until your Bug Blaster is destroyed.[CR]* If your Bug Blaster gets destroyed, all partially shot up mushrooms are regenerated, all poisoned mushrooms are restored to normal, and you start at the beginning of the wave you got killed on. [CR]* Depending on machine set up, all enemies (except the Centipede and Flea) speed up at the 1,000 or 5,000 point mark. [CR]* Bottom Side Tunnels : To perform this trick, you must do the following... [CR]1) When the Centipede is one row over the player's area (fifth mushroom up), go to the opposite side that the Centipede is on. [CR]2) When the Centipede turns around, it will be in the player's area. It then will make it to the side you are on. Right when it hits the side of the screen and turns around, shoot it. This creates a mushroom and forces the Centipede to turn around and go down one level. [CR]3) Again, after the Centipede hits the wall, shoot it, create a mushroom, and force it down another level. [CR]4) Continue to do this until you have only the bottom part left. There are two ways to do this : [CR]a) If you get killed by the Centipede, this will also create a mushroom and you will have a vertical line of mushrooms along one of the side. [CR]b) If you are quick, you can pick off the Centipede and create this last mushroom. [CR]5) Repeat this for the other side. [CR]6) Regardless of how you create this 'Side Tunnel', you will now have a trapped Centipede since the only thing it can do is go up and down within the player's area. New heads that come out will also be trapped. [CR]7) Now you can pick off enemies at your leisure. The only enemy you need to make sure you take out is the Spider since it can wipe out part of your 'Side Tunnel'. [CR]8) Good players consider this 'cheating' since it basically lets the player have free reign over the game. [CR]* Central Tunnel : This trick works along the same line as the 'Bottom Side Tunnel' trick. The difference is that you create a tunnel down the center of the screen... [CR]1) When the Centipede starts its descent, hit it. This will cause it to reverse direction after hitting the new mushroom. [CR]2) After going one or two mushroom lengths, hit it. Again, this will cause it to reverse direction. [CR]3) Continue to do this until you have built a 'tunnel' that touches the player's area. [CR]4) Also make sure you build up mushrooms to the left and right of the tunnel to prevent the Fleas from coming down and depositing their random mushrooms. [CR]5) From this point on, when the Centipede approaches your tunnel, all it will take is one hit to force it to descend. In a sense, you are causing the same effect that a Scorpion causes, but on your terms. [CR]6) Since you are keeping the top left and right areas clear, it should take a longer time for the individual heads to make it to the player's area. [CR]7) It will take a few waves to build up your areas. Once built up, you should be the master of the game. [CR]8) As for the other tunnel, make sure you take care of the Spiders when they first enter so they don't do any damage to your 'Central Tunnel'. [CR]9) Also make sure that you keep your tunnel cleared out by destroying any stray mushrooms within it.

				<plot>Circus Charlie (c) 1984 Konami Industry Company, Limited.[CR]Circus Charlie is a single-player abstract platform game in which the player must guide the eponymous Charlie through six different circus events. Bonus points can be won by finishing a level as quickly as possible, with further points awarded for collecting any of the money bags that occasionally appear.[CR]Finally, additional bonus points are awarded for completing a level without losing a life. The game is over when all Circus Charlies are lost.[CR]The six different events are:[CR]1. Ride a lion and jump through fiery hoops and over blazing pots. [CR]2. Jump over monkeys while walking a tightrope. [CR]3. Bounce on trampolines, avoid fire breathers and sword jugglers. [CR]4. Jump on giant, rolling beach balls. [CR]5.

Then a Charlie doll will appear from the front hanging. Catch it and get an extra player![CR]2) Fire rings : Jump over a pot from your back first and a coin may appear from the pot. Catch it to obtain bonus points. However, it happens only once per level. From which pot the coin may appear is determined randomly.[CR]3) Fire rings : If you get to the goal after getting all dollar bags, a hawk brings a dollar bag and you obtain bonus points.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Dig Dug</title_clean>
				<plot>Dig Dug (c) 1982 Namco.[CR]Dig Dug is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The screen shows a cutaway view of the land, most of which is below ground. The player controls the Dig Dug character who travels through and digs tunnels in the dirt. The object is for Dig Dug to destroy monsters by pumping them up or dropping rocks on them and to capture vegetables. [CR][B]Gameplay:[/B] takes place on a cutaway section of the land. The characters are Dig Dug and two monsters - one is a round, orange monster with goggles called Pooka, the other is a green, fire-breathing dragon named Fygar. The underground area is divided into four different colored layers of dirt. Rocks are scattered in the dirt. The sky is at the top of the screen. [CR]The player controls Dig Dug, the hero of the garden, clad in white. He moves through horizontal and vertical tunnels. When Dig Dug digs new tunnels he moves slowly. When he is on the surface or in an existing tunnel, he moves faster. The object of the game is for Dig Dug to destroy all the monsters and go to the next round. [CR]Monsters are trapped in caves. A monster may get out of a cave two ways. Dig Dug may dig him out. Then, the monster chases Dig Dug. The monster may also get out of the cave by turning into a ghost. As a ghost, he cannot be destroyed. The ghost does not travel in the tunnels. He travels through the dirt, and can travel diagonally. However, he reappears as the monster when he goes into a tunnel. [CR]The monsters move faster than Dig Dug in vertical tunnels and slower on the surface. They destroy Dig Dug by catching him. In addition, Fygar can destroy Dig Dug by breathing fire on him. Fygar can only breathe fire horizontally. The fire can also penetrate thin layers of dirt. [CR]Dig Dug destroys the monsters by pumping them up until they burst, or by causing rocks to drop on them. To pump up and destroy a monster, the player presses and holds down the Pump button. It is possible to stun a monster for a few seconds by pressing the pump button once or twice. While a monster is stunned, Dig Dug may pass over him without being destroyed. If two monsters are very close together, only one may be stunned. The other will catch and destroy Dig Dug. [CR]Dig Dug must dig tunnels under the rocks to get them to drop. A rock may fall in a vertical or horizontal tunnel. A rock also goes through a thin layer of dirt from one tunnel to the next. In a vertical tunnel, Dig Dug may stay directly under a rock and it will not drop. However, in a horizontal tunnel, Dig Dug must move out from under a rock right away, or he will be crushed. [CR]After two rocks are dropped, a vegetable (worth extra points, see Scoring below) appears in a tunnel in the center of the screen. Dig Dug has ten seconds to capture (touch) the vegetable or it will disappear. There is only one vegetable per round. [CR]The game progresses by rounds. Round 1 starts with four monsters (one Fygar and three Pookas) and three rocks. The vegetable is a carrot. One flower on the surface (top right of the screen) represents Round 1. Two flowers represent Round 2, etc. As the rounds progress, the monsters move a little faster, and are better at avoiding falling rocks. In each round, the last monster tries to escape. If he is not caught by Dig Dug, he exits on the surface (top left). [CR]The game ends when all of Dig Dug's lives are used up. A player may continue to play at the beginning of the same round (level) by following instructions on the screen. He or she has 16 seconds to insert a coin(s). Then he or she must push and hold the Pump and Start buttons at the same time.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz) [CR]Sub CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 4-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 1 (PUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Dig Dug was released on April 19, 1982 in Japan.[CR]Dig Dug was a shining addition to the golden age of video games. The game's charming world and innovative game play made it an instant classic. [CR]The main character of Dig Dug has a name in Japan, 'Taizo Hori', a pun based on the phrase 'Horitai zo', or 'I want to dig!'. He is believed to be the father of "Mr. Driller".  He makes an appearance on the 2012 animation movie 'Wreck-It Ralph' from Walt Disney Animation Studios.[CR]* A place in video game history : "During the golden age of video games we saw a lot of novel approaches to gaming," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "'Tempest', for instance, required things of its players that we'd never seen in a video game before. You had to learn a whole new set of skills to further the game experience. Dig Dug is another game that provided a novel approach. The types of movement you had to learn, the skills you had to develop, were like none other up until that point. And this game play was combined with a really engaging subject matter, which was this guy, Dig Dug, who digs around underground after subterranean monsters, and who explodes them with a really bizarre weapon, an air pump! There was just this string of interesting, engaging things for the viewer to look at and experience while dealing with this new type of game. It really captured, and still captures, the imagination. The sounds in Dig Dug are also really distinctive. When people hear that music start to play here at the museum, they'll laugh with recognition. It's quite funny watching people play that game." [CR]* The great 25-cent escape : Lindsey enjoys seeing visitors to his museum discover a video game that rekindles memories from earlier years. [CR]"They'll say, 'Wow, I used to be great at this!' And then they'll adopt their old game-playing position -- which seems to vary almost randomly from person to person, " Lindsey said. "They drop a token in, start rolling, and then they will lose all sense of time and space, becoming completely immersed in the game. Often they'll start laughing. I had a guy yesterday who was so funny. He came in and had obviously played these video games quite a bit in years past, like many of us did. He wandered around the museum, going from game to game, and he just laughed hysterically as he remembered all the little details of each game that he had spent so much time on, so long ago." [CR]* Namco notes that after the release of Dig Dug in 1982, Namco engineers went to arcades to watch their new game being played. They noticed that "there were two completely separate groups of people. One group enjoyed blowing the enemy up with the pump. The other group enjoyed beating the enemy by dropping rocks on them".

In addition, you even get points for 'eating' dirt. [CR]* Over-inflating (bursting) monsters : [CR]Layer 1 : 200 Points [CR]Layer 2 : 300 Points [CR]Layer 3 : 400 Points [CR]Layer 4 : 500 Points [CR]NOTE : If you over-inflate a Fygar horizontally, you will get double the listed points. This is due to the fact that you are risking your life dealing with Fygar's flame breath. [CR]* Dropping rocks on monsters : [CR]1 Crushed : 1,000 Points [CR]2 Crushed : 2,500 Points [CR]3 Crushed : 4,000 Points [CR]4 Crushed : 6,000 Points [CR]5 Crushed : 8,000 Points [CR]6 Crushed : 10,000 Points [CR]7 Crushed : 12,000 Points [CR]8 Crushed : 15,000 Points [CR]* You get points for collecting the prizes : [CR]Round 1 - Carrot : 400 Points [CR]Round 2 - Rutabaga : 600 Points [CR]Round 3 - Mushroom : 800 Points [CR]Rounds 4 &amp; 5 - Cucumber : 1,000 Points [CR]Rounds 6 &amp; 7 - Eggplant : 2,000 Points [CR]Rounds 8 &amp; 9 - Bell Pepper : 3,000 Points [CR]Rounds 10 &amp; 11 - Tomato : 4,000 Points [CR]Rounds 12 &amp; 13 - Onion : 5,000 Points [CR]Rounds 14 &amp; 15 - Watermelon : 6,000 Points [CR]Rounds 16 &amp; 17 - Galaxian : 7,000 Points [CR]Round 18 onward - Pineapple : 8,000 Points [CR]When you are digging a new tunnel, you get 10 points per 5/8 inch (app. 1.6 cm.) dug.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hints for Game Play : [CR]1) Get many monsters to follow you. Then dig a long vertical tunnel up to a rock. [CR]2) Drop the rock by digging right or left. [CR]3) Dig Dug may take extra time to turn. It is better to start turning early than to wait until the last second. [CR]4) Destroy monsters at bottom dirt level for more points. [CR]5)Use the Pump button to stun monsters. Then you may escape or walk through them. [CR]6) Don't stop next to Fygar when he is in a cave. His fire can go through a thin layer of dirt and destroy you. [CR]7) A prize appears after two rocks have been dropped. So be sure to drop two rocks in each round. [CR]* When you start the game, Dig Dug will dig a downward vertical shaft into a chamber. The floor of this chamber is the top of the third layer. It is your job to dig tunnels and keep the monsters busy. This won't be an easy task since the monsters will attempt to surround Dig Dug and permanently end his mining career. You will have a two second delay before the round starts. It shows Dig Dug digging his vertical tunnel down to his starting area. Take this time to see where all the monsters are and figure out the best course of action to take them out. [CR]* Knowing the behavior of the monsters is a crucial element of this game. Pookas travel a bit faster then Dig Dug and tend to run him down. Fygars don't have the speed but they make up for it with their fiery belch. [CR]* Dig Dug travels slower when he is busy carving tunnels. [CR]* Know the rules of dropping rocks : [CR]1) Rocks will wobble for about a second before they drop. [CR]2) Rocks drop immediately when you cut a horizontal tunnel under them. [CR]3) In vertical tunnels, the rock will stay in place as long as Dig Dug is facing it and moving. [CR]4) When you drop two rocks, the prize will appear. [CR]* Don't waste your rocks on only one monster. Try to get as many monsters crushed as possible. The best way to accomplish this is : [CR]1) Try to dig long, vertical tunnels under the rocks. Don't dig all the way to the rock or you will waste it. [CR]2) Try to get the monsters to follow you. Sort of a ''follow the leader'' type thing up that vertical tunnel. This will be especially important in the later rounds. [CR]3) If the monsters are spread out a little, do a couple of pumps on the monster that is close. This will only stun it and allow the others to catch up. [CR]4) Right before they get Dig Dug, dig the rest of the way then head off left or right. The long, vertical shaft will prevent their escape and get you big points. [CR]* There are a total of 15 unique layouts in the game. After Round 15, layouts 12-15 repeat over and over in waves of four. There are patterns for these levels. Also, after Round 36, all of the enemies will speed up. The game does not award extra man after 900,000 points; the score will simply flip over at 1,000,000. It is very easy to get a score of 999,990 by eating dirt for ten points per section. Round 256 begins with a Pooka on top of Dig Dug. Since there is no way to escape, the game is basically over, no matter how many lives the player may have left. [CR]* Avoid killing the monsters by bursting them. If you don't have a choice, try to do in the lower layers since you get more points that way. [CR]* The pump is better utilized as a delay mechanism. Inflating a monster with two pumps will immobilize it for about two seconds. With two monsters, you can pump one up, move back a little and pump the other one up. [CR]* Monsters can be released from their pens in one of two ways : [CR]1) You open up their pen by digging it open. [CR]2) They turn into 'ghosts'. While they are ghosts, Pookas appear only as goggles, and Fygars appear as a set of evil eyes and a mouth. They will rematerialize as soon as they get into a tunnel. [CR]* Watch out for the fiery breath of Fygar. They not only can let loose down a horizontal tunnel, they also can send their fire through thin layers of dirt. The best defense when caught in a horizontal tunnel with a Fygar is to immediately go up or down to avoid their breath. [CR]* The Pookas have a tendency to try to surround Dig Dug. Usually they will try to trap him from the front and behind. Watch the Pooka 'ghosts' to make sure that they are not heading toward an area that you are currently tunnelling in. [CR]* It is possible to find patterns for the different levels, but it also is difficult since there isn't a well-defined maze to work with (like in "Pac-Man"). [CR]* When there is one monster left, it will attempt to escape rather then continue to pursue Dig Dug. You can chase him to get the points or let him go. Regardless, the game will advance to the next round. [CR]* In the later rounds, it is much more profitable to collect the prizes, then try to drop rocks on the monsters since they move so quickly. [CR]* 'Eat Dirt' secret : You should try this before round 36 since everything speeds up. [CR]1) Get the game down to two Pookas. If you only leave one, it will escape thus ending the round. [CR]2) This works best in horizontal tunnels under the rocks. [CR]3) Get a Pooka to follow you, inflate as necessary to delay him a little. [CR]4) Right when you are next to the rock, inflate the Pooka once to just delay him. When he moves at your character again, move under the rock. [CR]5) Quickly turn around and start pumping the Pooka up. Using the delay of the rock dropping, you should be able to cause the Pooka to burst at the same time the rock drops on him. [CR]6) If you are successful, then the other Pooka will disappear and you can amuse yourself digging out tunnels all day long in the dirt. To return the game back to normal, drop another rock and you will go into the next round. [CR]* Ender's loop: To beat any round of Dig Dug, one must take advantage of the artificial intelligence. One way to do this is to dig out either left or right from the starting position, dig up a short way from your starting position, turn around and continue digging out your initial tunnel, then go up again (this time further away from your start position) until you are higher than the end of your first vertical tunnel. Continue from here in the opposite direction of the direction you went at the beginning of the level, until you have almost reached the vertical tunnel that exists before you start any given level of the game. Create a thin wall between you and the vertical tunnel, and pump the enemies up as they pass by - but watch out, as the Fygars can still burn you.[CR]* Late game:[CR]Score: As with most of the other early Namco 8-bit arcade games, once you have made it to 999,990 points, your score will roll over to 0. No additional extra lives will be awarded now.[CR]Flowers: The flowers that indicate the rounds on the surface of the ground will stop updating at round 69, but the indicator at the bottom of the screen will continue updating until round 99 before rolling over to round 0. At this point there will be no flowers. Once you have made it to round 101, the flowers will update again until you reach round 256 (is the "kill screen").[CR]Slow enemies: In the original arcade versions of the game by Namco, the Pookas and Fygars will slow down once you have made it to round 124, and again once you have made it to round 136. This reduction in speed will continue every twelve rounds, until you reach round 256 (which, as mentioned above, is the "kill screen" - and is described in full detail below).[CR]Kill screen: In the original Namco versions of the game, the game has a "kill screen" on round 256, which is registered by the game as round 0. The round starts with a Pooka directly on top of Dig Dug, which will cause the player to lose all of his remaining lives very quickly. The Atari revisions of the game (which changed the logo on the titles) correct this problem.[CR]* Easter Egg : [CR]1) Enter service mode. [CR]2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Up(x6), Right(x3), Down(x4), Left(x8). [CR]3) '(c) 1982 NAMCO LTD.' will appear on the screen.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Dig Dug II (c) 1985 Namco.[CR]For this sequel to the 1982 classic, "Dig Dug", Namco changed the game's perspective from a sideways viewpoint, to an overhead one. Action now takes place on a series of small islands. [CR]The gameplay itself retains much from its predecessor, with players still armed with a pump that allows them to inflate and burst the enemies. For this sequel, however, Namco also introduced ground-based charges. Players can activate the charges in order to join them up with other charges, represented on screen by the appearance of trenches. Once a line of charges is linked to two of the island's edges, the charges will detonate and destroy a piece of the island, killing any enemies that happen to be standing on the piece when it's destroyed. Players must be careful not to be standing on a piece that is destroyed, or they themselves will be killed.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : D2 [CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 8-channel WSG [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 4-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 2 [CR]= &gt; [1] Pump, [2] Drill[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Dig Dug II was released in March 1985 in Japan. [CR]The main character of Dig Dug has a name in Japan, 'Taizo Hori', a pun based on the phrase 'Horitai zo', or 'I want to dig!'.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Learn the lay of the land: On your first visit to any island, try to take as much time to study it as possible. Concentrate on eliminating enemies with your pump, and try to leave at least two enemies until you are done studying the island. Look for ground pegs that you can take advantage of, and create landslides with. Once you have played any island at least twice, you should be familiar enough with it to execute your plan to create a landslide as soon as you start. If you miss the opportunity to do it early on, you may have to spend more time luring enemies away from the site and bring them back when you are ready.[CR]* Landslides are easier in the beginning: The early rounds are obviously easier than the later ones, and they are designed to maximize landslide opportunities. As you are playing further in the game, you will begin to notice that it will become harder to find an obvious landslide situation and you will have to become more creative. When you are familiar with the early rounds, take advantage of the easy landslide setups to give your score a nice boost. And don't forget, three landslides earns you a bonus vegetable which helps your score out as well. As you progress through the game, switch to relying on your pump for easier kills.[CR]* Cracks are your best defense: You should remember that unless Pookas or Fygars become ghosts, they cannot cross over the cracks. Even if you cannot necessarily use a peg to create a landslide, you can still use them to create cracks in the ground and generally make it more difficult for enemies to get around. In some cases, you can use cracks to break up a pack of Pookas that have bunched together. In other cases, you can create a "fence" of cracks, and leave one section alone as a "gate". Then you can lure all of the enemies behind the fence and close the gate by creating the last crack and watch them all drown in the sea as the point value you earned for doing so flies across the screen. Remember, however, that a determined enemy can become a ghost and begin floating over a crack very slowly. Always be on the lookout and never stay in one section for too long. Dig Dug is never totally safe.[CR]* Later rounds: It takes more skill than strategy to win in the later rounds. Landslide opportunities are severely limited, and the multitude of enemies start coming at you very quickly. You must use the pegs to create cracks that you can use as a line of defense. The enemies will gather together, and you may need to use the pump stall technique learned in the first Dig Dug (where you had to pump up an enemy to stall them and safely pass through them) in order to get away a lot of the time. When you put some distance between you and the pack of enemies, find a crack to stand behind and pump enemies from behind the line until one becomes a ghost. If you're fast enough, you can kill one enemy, and start pumping the ghost before it reaches you. If not, or if there are too many ghosts coming at you, you should prepare to run away, and find another hiding spot. Thorough knowledge of the island layout can help you set up two safety zones if you need to run back and forth, but you should always be careful not to accidentally run into any enemies.[CR]* Easter Egg (works on the new version only, old version doesn't have it) : [CR]1) Enter service mode. [CR]2) Select sound 1B. [CR]3) Press the service switch to display the grid and enter the following sequence : Down(x2), Right, Left(x2), Down(x2), Left(x3), Up(x2). [CR]4)Press the service switch again. Some music will play and 'DIGDUGII (c) 1985 NAMCO LTD.' will be slowly drawn on the screen. [CR]* Pause/Resume : When the 'freeze' dip switch is on, at the beginning of the game select starting level with joystick Up/Down, then press the Drill button. During the game, press the Start button to pause/resume.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Dig Dug (1982, ARC)[CR]2. Dig Dug II (1985, ARC)[CR]3.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Donkey Kong</title_clean>
				<plot>Donkey Kong (c) 1981 Nintendo of America, Incorporated.[CR]Export version for North America. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese upright version entry.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Blue Upright model] [CR]The blue uprights (which are the most common), are a very rectangular affair, with quite a lot of artwork. They have orange-ish sticker style side-art (with Mario and Kong on them), with control panel, marquee, and monitor bezel graphics to match. This game does not use a standard arcade monitor. It requires a 'Nintendo Compatible' monitor (a normal monitor will display the picture like that of a photographic negative). This simple little monitor change basically launched the entire Nintendo Vs. Unisystem later on. Because only Donkey Kong series games and Vs. titles would work on these monitors (forcing operators to buy conversion kits for those games instead of a competitors game). [CR][Red Upright model] [CR]The red upright versions are actually "Radar Scope" cabinets that have been factory-converted to Donkey Kong. These are fairly rare and feature slightly different gameplay.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Donkey Kong was released in July 1981 in the USA.[CR]Donkey Kong was to be Nintendo's first big breakthrough into the western - and particularly American - arcade scene. Before Donkey Kong, Nintendo was having difficulty establishing itself in these markets. After the game's massive success Nintendo quickly established their headquarters of Nintendo of America to ensure that the game was being distributed properly. [CR]Mario was named after Mario Segale, the landlord of Nintendo of America's first warehouse location in Seattle (though it was debated whether this occurred before or well after the game was released). Mario was originally called 'Jumpman'; only the arcade version of Donkey Kong has ever called the hero Jumpman; most home coversions, particularly the NES version, game him the Mario name.[CR]Accounts differ as to how Nintendo of America felt about the game before its release. Many sources claim that they all felt sure it would be an absolute disaster while others say they were more optimistic.[CR]Although Mario is a plumber in later games, his career in Donkey Kong is that of a carpenter. Mario's appearance (and consequently his career) was dictated by the primitive graphics hardware of the time - the only way to have his arms appear 'separate' to his torso was to have them as a different color - hence he wears 'dungarees'. The mustache is present merely to indicate where Mario's mouth is, again due to the low graphics resolution imposed by hardware limitations. Mario wears a hat so his head is distinguishable from the game's black backgrounds. [CR]About 60,000 units were sold in the US. Oddly, despite it being one of the ten best selling games of the golden age of video games, it never reached #1 on Replay's popularity charts. Instead, it was stuck at #2 behind mega hits "Pac-Man" and "Ms. Pac-Man" - the two best selling games ever. [CR]Donkey Kong inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Do The Donkey Kong' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. [CR]A Donkey Kong unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', the 1984 movie 'Gremlins', the 1985 movie 'The Heavenly Kid', and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men' (Season 5, Episode 2 - People Who Love Peepholes). [CR]MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) in 1982. Save the girl and avoid the barrels and fireballs as in the video game. The gameboard is laid out like the video game's Ramp Stage. 'Can You Battle Donkey Kong and Save the Fair Maiden?'. [CR]Donkey Kong also spawned a cartoon series of the same name : Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced by Joe Ruby and Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS. Mario was voiced by veteran voice actor Peter Cullen, while Donkey Kong's voice was provided by the late actor/comedian Soupy Sales (1926-2009). [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game (Blue Upright model). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The original Japanese version had all four stages displayed in their original, logical order 1-2-3-4.[CR]For this US version, they changed it to match the 'How High Can You Try/Get?' theme, with the stage order as follows : [CR]L-01 : 1-4 [CR]L-02 : 1-3-4 [CR]L-03 : 1-2-3-4 (as in all levels of the Japanese version) [CR]L-04 : 1-2-1-3-4 [CR]L-05 : 1-2-1-3-1-4 [CR]L-06 through L-21 all remain the same as L-05 [CR]L-22 : 1 (Kill screen).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Mr. Do's Castle</title_clean>
				<plot>Mr. Do's Castle (c) 1983 Universal.[CR]For the second game in the Mr. Do! series, the clown finds himself in a traditional platforms and ladders game. Each level is made up of six floors (seven including the castle's ramparts) and all are joined by a number of inter-connecting ladders. The ladders come in two different varieties: vertical ladders, which are fixed and cannot be moved; and diagonal ladders, which can be pushed left or right from the top of the ladder. This allows Mr. Do to reach other areas of the level and is sometimes necessary to redirect the path of any pursuing enemies. [CR]The enemies in Mr. Do's Castle come in the form of unicorns, and as with the enemies of the first game, they will hunt down and try to kill Mr. Do. Replacing the 'Powerball' weapon of the original game, Mr. Do is now armed with a mallet. This can be used to temporarily stun the unicorns and buy Mr. Do some time to escape; but its primary function is to knock out the floor blocks that form each level's platforms.[CR]Most blocks are marked with a cherry and collecting all of these will complete the level (on later revisions only, see Updates below). A level can also be completed by killing all of the unicorns. This is achieved by using the mallet to remove blocks and knock holes in the platforms. The unicorns will fall into any holes that the player has created; some simply fall through to the platform below, whereas others are trapped. Trapped unicorns can be hit with Mr. Do's mallet and knocked to a lower platform - useful for buying a few extra seconds for the player. If left alone, however, the unicorns will climb out, filling the hole in behind them, and transform into much nastier enemies. These new enemies cannot be stunned with the mallet and must be killed by dropping blocks onto them from the platform above.[CR]Some sections of a platform have two 'skull' blocks at either end of them, with normal blocks in between. When both skull blocks are knocked out with the mallet, all of the blocks in between will fall to reveal wooden floorboards. This is highly effective in killing several enemies at once.[CR]Each level also has three 'key' blocks. If Mr. Do knocks out all three key blocks, a large door opens at the top of the screen to reveal a shield which, when collected, turns the unicorns into 'Alphamonsters'. The Alphamonsters flee from Mr. Do and can be killed either with the mallet, or by dropping a floor block onto them from above. When Mr. Do kills an Alphamonster, its letter appears on a flagpole at the top of the screen. If the players collects all five letters, an extra life is awarded.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.9 Mhz), (2x) Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (4x) Texas Instruments SN76496 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Mr. Do's Castle was released in September 1983.[CR]The Asian version of this game is known as "Mr. Do! vs. Unicorns".[CR]Barry Lewis holds the official record for this game with 421,780 points.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Earlier versions (including the Asian version, "Mr. Do! vs. Unicorns") : [CR]* There are no cherry blocks, so hammering all the blocks is NOT a way to complete a level. At the start of each level, normal blocks will appear in the form of 'fill blocks' - those that appear in the later versions after unicorns have refilled holes. In addition, the colors on these blocks change after every two levels.[CR]Later versions : [CR]* Normal blocks now have cherries embedded on them at the start of each level. Hammering all of the cherry blocks is a new way to complete the level.[CR]* The replay Diamond was added.[CR]* Fill blocks no longer change colors after every two levels.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Knocking a block onto a red unicorn below so it falls one level : 500 points.[CR]Knocking a block onto a red unicorn below so it falls two levels : 1,000 points.[CR]Knocking a block onto a red unicorn below so it falls three levels : 1,500 points.[CR]Knocking a block onto a red unicorn below so it falls four levels : 2,000 points.[CR]Killing a green unicorn : x2 points.[CR]Killing a blue unicorn : x3 points.[CR]Killing 2, 3 or 4 unicorns with one block : x2, x4, x6 points.[CR]Collecting the free credit diamond (later versions only) : 8,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Make use of the rows of blocks marked with a skull at each end. Knock out one skull block and all of the middle blocks, wait for unicorns to fall into the gaps and knock out the other skull block. This will cause the whole row of blocks to fall, killing all unicorns in the holes and below.[CR]* Use your hammer to briefly stun a pursuing unicorn, allowing you to escape.[CR]* If a unicorn is chasing you up a diagonal ladder, push the top of the ladder away when you reach the top so the unicorn ends up on a different platform.[CR]* Blue unicorns are quite dangerous, and after a certain amount of time they duplicate themselves, so kill them as fast as you can if you don't want to be outnumbered![CR]* You can kill a unicorn on the same level as you if he is standing on a block when you hit it. The unicorn will fall and you will be awarded the same score as if you had knocked the block down onto the unicorn.[CR]* If a unicorn is filling a hole vacated by a block, you can hammer it to knock the unicorn down to the next level. Note you CANNOT do this to a blue unicorn.[CR]* Wait until all unicorns are as close as possible before collecting the cross to turn them into Alphamonsters, giving you more chance to kill more of them.[CR]* You can fall from any height and will not die so jump down through gaps to avoid unicorns.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Dr. Micro (c) 1983 Sanritsu.[CR]An early platform game in which the player must defeat a mad scientist, avoiding and destroying his evil creations in the process.[CR]The game consists of 3 single-screen levels :[CR]On the first the player must move from the left to the right of the screen, dropping down onto constantly moving metal pillars and shooting the enemies.[CR]On the second level, the player must steer a floating ball around the screen, killing as many enemies as possible. Once enough enemies have been killed, an exit will open which the player must enter. The floating ball gradually diminishes and the player will have to drop to the bottom of the screen several times to get a replacement ball.[CR]The final screen takes place on the scientist's production line; with machinery that must be carefully negotiated. Two large robots bar the route to the scientist and must be destroyed before the scientist can be reached.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips: (3x) Texas Instruments SN76496 (@ 4.608 Mhz), OKI MSM5205 (@ 384 Khz)[CR]Screen orientation: Vertical[CR]Video resolution: 224 x 256 pixels[CR]Screen refresh: 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors: 32[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]The gradually deprecating platforms in this game (in the form of beach-balls) may be the first occurrence of this mechanism in the platform game genre. Numerous other examples would follow, including such examples as the perishable missiles in Contra 3 (SNES) which the player would cling to mid-level for want of sterner grounding.[CR]While much of the content herein resembles the original Donkey Kong series, little else can be detracted from Dr. Micro in terms of originality.[CR]The 'Evil Doctor' nemesis may also have established its video gaming roots here- subsequent incarnations are most obvious in the RockMan / MegaMan series.[CR]Even the title's font seems to resemble Capcom's fine platform / shooter.[CR]It is also fair to say that Dr. Micro pioneers unusually detailed features for it&#8217;s time- the lifeboat beneath our hero's feet, for example, follows him meticulously throughout the first screen.[CR]The music that plays in the background is the song 'Chitty Chitty Bang Bang', originally from the Metro Goldwyn Mayer musical of the same name. You're pretty much going to sing the song at some point if you play the game.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Developed by: Sanritsu[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Eyes (c) 1982 Rock-Ola Mfg. Corp.[CR]The player controls a hat-wearing eyeball in a maze. As in Pac-Man, the goal is to collect all of the dots to advance to next level, but in Eyes you shoot the dots rather than eat them. Computer-controlled eyes chase and shoot at the player. Shooting a computer eye gives points and removes it from the level, but it will reappear a short time later. Being shot by a computer eye is fatal.[CR]As the game progresses, more computer eyes are added to levels and they take less time to shoot at the player.

				<plot>Frogger (c) 1981 Konami Industry Company, Limited.[CR]Frogger is a 1- or 2-player game in which players move their frog from the bottom to the top of the screen. This is achieved by overcoming a number of hazards without getting run over or drowned. [CR]The first half of the screen is a bi-directional flow of traffic including busses, cars and racecars. Players must avoid these vehicles. Frogs can move safely with the flow of traffic to make their way to the second half of the screen, which consists of a river with fast moving logs and sinkable turtles. Frogs must hop on the backs of the logs and the turtles to get to the home base at the top of the screen. At random times throughout the game play, a lady frog will appear on a log. Bonus points are scored if the frog successfully hops on the back of the lady frog and escorts her safely home. A fly will also appear randomly in a home base. Bonus points can be scored if the frog hops in the home base when the fly is present. Sinking turtles also swiftly move across the river with the logs. If a frog is unsuccessful in hopping on a turtle's back, the frog will sink and drown. Crocodiles, snakes, and otters also roam the moving river waiting to eat frogs on their way up to the home base. Players can hop on their back (except the snake, whose touch is deadly), but they must avoid their open mouths. The frog must be lined up perfectly to enter one of the 5 home bases. Players must maneuver the frogs to their home base within the allotted time (60 beats on the timer). [CR]The frog can move vertically or horizontally by maneuvering the joystick. Players must maneuver the frog swiftly and precisely without getting run over, drowned, or eaten by the creatures that roam the flowing river. Avoiding traffic, deadly snakes, otters, crocodiles, and the treacherous diving turtles make game action stimulating in Frogger.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX392[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.78975 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.78975 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-Way Joystick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Frogger was released by Konami in June 1981 in Japan; it became a runaway hit. [CR]1981 was a big year in video games. A lot of companies were putting some pretty popular games on the market and it created a very competitive atmosphere as to what company was putting out the most popular ones. In addition, 1981 continued on the trend of the 'cute' type games such as "Ms. Pac-Man", "Qix", and a host of Pac-Man clones. Konami was already becoming a force to be reckoned with in the video gaming world. With such hits as "Space War", "Scramble", and "Super Cobra", Konami was making its mark. [CR]The sound that can be heard when a coin is inserted into the machine was sampled by producer Richard X for the Sugababes' song, 'Freak Like Me' (and is the very first sound on the track). [CR]Frogger has numerous bugs, although many of these are not immediately apparent to the average player : [CR]1. Sections of the music will occasionally cut out, although the main melody will continue to play. [CR]2. On occasion, Frogger displays a somewhat haphazard approach to collision detection. One side effect of this is that the player can sometimes make a perfectly legal and safe jump and still lose a life. Another side effect of this is that the player can jump up onto the first row of turtles, and then immediately jump back. This will place the player 'off the grid', and it is now possible to jump right off the side of the screen, leading to a loss of life. [CR]3. There are several other odd jumps that can be made as well. Firstly, the player can 'hang off' the left side of a turtle, but attempting to do the same on the right side results in death. If the player jumps onto a home base with an alligator (and the 'gator vanishes after you jump, but before the player lands), Frogger will be killed, but he will ALSO make it home. Finally, left and right jumps on the top row of logs are sometimes much slower than usual - this is more likely to occur after previously eating a fly. [CR]4. Another in-game bug is that the lady frog will sometimes be invisible, but will flash red when the player jumps onto the spot where she is. [CR]Mark Robichek holds the official record for this game with 442330 points. [CR]A Frogger unit appears in the 1999 movie 'Magnolia' and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men'; Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes). [CR]Frogger inspired a catchy hit song by Buckner and Garcia called 'Froggy's Lament' released on the 'Pac-Man Fever' album. [CR]The TV show, Seinfeld, has an episode named 'The Frogger'. George and Jerry are in Mario's Pizza which is closing down, and they find a Frogger game still there. They realize that the high score of 860630 points has George's initials GLC [George Louis Costanza]. They reminisce about the night it happened : "I was unstoppable!... Just the right amount of grease on the joystick". George decides to buy the Frogger machine to immortalize his high score, but Jerry informs him that unplugging the game will erase all of the scores. Later, George tries in vain to call an electrician to help : "I need a guy that can rig a Frogger machine so that I can move it without losing power, 'cause I have the high score. H-hello?". Kramer suggests an electrician who can help. George says, "Kramer, listen to me. I'm never gonna have a child. If I lose this Frogger high score, that's it for me". George assembles a team and hatches a plan to salvage the game. But when he arrives, he finds the team playing the game, which has only three minutes of battery life left. They can't get it back in the closed pizzeria, but there is an open pharmacy across the street where it could be plugged in. George decides to push the machine across the highway, and an overhead shot of this feat looks much like the Frogger game itself, and the music from the game is played. At the end, George is unable to push the game onto the sidewalk and it gets destroyed by an oncoming truck. [CR]MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game (same name) the same year, 'One Wrong Leap Will Get You Squished And Splattered' : in this version of the game, 2 players face off, each with their own army of frogs, logs, and automobiles. Each turn, a player spends his movement points either moving his frogs toward their goal (the other side of the board), or moving logs and cars in an attempt to block or squash the other player's frogs. Complete with 'bonus points' for landing on flies, this is actually a pretty faithful interpretation of the video-game; but far too simple to have any long-lasting interest. More of a curiosity for video game enthusiasts than anything. [CR]Frogger also spawned a cartoon series of the same name : Ruby-Spears Productions. Produced By Joe Ruby, Ken Spears. Originally aired September 17, 1983 as part of 'Saturday Supercade' on CBS. [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR]The Main character appear, on the 2012 animation movie "Wreck-It Ralph" from Walt Disney Animation Studios.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Forward Hop : 10 points (max points per home is 100)[CR]Frog Safely Put in Home : 50 points[CR]Completing a Level : 1000 points[CR]Bringing a Frog to Your Home : 200 points[CR]Eating a Fly : 200 points[CR]You also get a time bonus of 10 x the remaining seconds added to your score.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your frog will start at the bottom of the screen. You will have 60 seconds to move your frog up 10 spaces and successfully put it in their home. If you are successful, then you will try to put a frog in the next home and so on until you fill up all five homes with frogs. When you do this, you progress to the next level. [CR]* Note the traffic flow of the 2 parts. The cars travel on the roadway from left to right while the logs, turtles, crocodiles, etc. travel on the water lanes in the following direction : [CR]a) Lanes #1, #3, and #5 go from right to left. [CR]b) Lanes #2 and #4 go from left to right. [CR]* First, you must cross the highway. You will become road kill if a vehicle hits you or you hit a vehicle. Try to find 'lanes' in between the vehicles. You must plan for gaps to form in the first three lanes so you don't become trapped. The vehicles in the first three lanes move slowly enough that you can jump side to side with reasonable safety. [CR]* Lane #4 is the dangerous lane. Depending on how much time you are taking, the cars may pick up speed even though it shows slow on the chart. Keep this in mind when you are moving your frog. [CR]* At level 3, a snake will either be in the median or on the log in water lane #3. The snake is deadly to your frog and you cannot hop over it. [CR]* The turtles are pretty easy to navigate over in water lanes #1 and #4. Be wary of the diving turtles and only use them as a quick bypass to a more solid footing. If your frog is on a diving turtle when it dives, your frog will drown. [CR]* Again, time your jumps to coincide with the logs and turtles to ensure you will always have a solid footing to jump to. As the levels progress, you will have less things you can jump to. [CR]* You can jump on the backs of the crocodiles and otters. Just don't get near their mouths or they are apt to turn your frog into a meal. [CR]* You may see a purple lady frog hopping around on a log in water lane #2. Just cross over her to give her a piggyback ride to your home and get an extra 200 points. [CR]* Watch out for the snakes, they sometimes like to ride on the logs. If you see a snake on a log, jump back to solid footing. [CR]* Your frog cannot 'wrap-around' the screen so make sure you bail off before that footing disappears off the edge of the screen or your frog will come out the other side in a squished condition. [CR]* By that same token, if you have the time and necessary footing, you can hold out until the fly appears in your home before you settle your frog in. That's another 200 points. [CR]* Try to fill in the two end homes before going for the middle. The hardest home to get into is the left-hand one (home #1) since everything in water lane #5 goes from right to left. This means you may have to bounce back to water lane #4 so you can get a good shot at your home. [CR]* Speaking of getting your frogs into their homes, you must hit exact center or your frog will die. Also, keep in mind that crocodiles like to randomly appear in your home. Make sure that your home is clear before trying to settle your frog down into it. [CR]* Again, if you waste too much time, the things on the river will move quicker so you will have to adjust your strategy accordingly. [CR]* When the game is playing in attract mode, you can control the frog. When the frog reaches water lane #4, you can control the frog's movements until you move either up or down. [CR]* If you jump into your home at the same time the crocodile is leaving your home, you will be credited with making to your home but you will still lose a frog in the process. [CR]* You can dangle your frog from the left side of the turtles but not the right side. [CR]* Your side-to-side movements in water lane #5 may be slow and sluggish. [CR]* The lady frog will sometimes be invisible. In this case, the only time you know she's there is when you jump on her. She will then ride on your back to your home.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Galaga (c) 1981 Namco. [CR]Galaga is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a 'Fighter' spaceship and must defend the home planet against the on-coming hordes of alien invaders called "Galagans". The Fighter can only move left and right along the bottom of the screen. [CR]Galagans fly onto the screen in a variety of formations before forming troop lines at the top of the screen. Once all troop lines are formed the Galagans separate and start attacking the player's Fighter in ones, twos and threes. The top-line Boss Galaga need to be shot twice before they are destroyed. [CR]The Boss Galaga has a tractor beam that can capture the player's Fighter. A captured Fighter changes color from white to red and stays with that particular Boss until it is destroyed. The Fighter can be retrieved by destroying the Boss that captured it, but players must be careful not to destroy the captured Fighter itself, or that Fighter is lost. A rescued Fighter changes color back to white and links up with the player's current Fighter, doubling its fire power. [CR]As players progress through each screen, the speed and number of alien attacks increases. Alien formations also become more complex, making the aliens harder to shoot. [CR]Bonus Fighters are awarded periodically throughout the game, as players reach specific point values, as dictated by the 'Bonus Life' dip switch setting. Each enemy ship also has an assigned point value (see Scoring below). [CR]The alien troop lines that form at the top of the screen are, from top to bottom: Boss Galaga (in one row of four), Butterflies (red/white bug ships, in two rows of eight, directly below the Boss Galaga), and Bees (blue/yellow bug ships, in two rows of ten, directly below the Butterflies). [CR]In Stage 1, the enemies do not drop bombs as they fly onto the screen. However, they do so in most of the later stages. [CR]From Stage 4 onwards, a squadron of special bonus enemies called "transforms" start appearing. They're called transforms because Bees will begin pulsating and move out of formation to change into these bonus enemies. They appear in the form of yellow scorpions in Stages 4, 5, and 6, green 'Spy Ships' from "Bosconian" in Stages 8, 9, and 10, and Galaxian Flagships in Stages 12, 13, and 14. After that, the three different transforms are repeated in the same order. Transforms are always worthwhile targets because they are not very aggressive and are worth more than the other enemies. If all three transforms are destroyed, extra bonus points will be awarded. [CR]Galaga also features CHALLENGING STAGES, these consist of 40 Galagans that fly onto the screen in formations but do not drop any bombs. The object is to shoot as many of them as possible before they leave the play area. When an entire formation of eight Galagans is destroyed, bonus points are added to the player's score. If all 40 aliens are destroyed, players are awarded a special bonus of 10,000 points. [CR]Two new gameplay features Galaga introduced are : [CR]1) Players are given the chance to double their fire power. [CR]2) The game has a rapid fire (automatic firing) option, whereby the player simply holds the FIRE button down and the space fighter continues to fire at the Galagan army in bursts of two missiles each.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model][CR]Game ID : GG[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (x3), MB88xx[CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG, discrete circuitry (for the ship explosion sound)[CR]Palette colors : 32 (16 colors for tiles + 16 colors for sprites)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Galaga was released in September 1981 in Japan.[CR]Although Galaga was a superior game, it didn't sell the large numbers that "Galaxian" did. One of the first games with a bonus stage. [CR]The game 'rolls over' at 999,990 points. The 1P score counter is six digits, but the 2P counter is seven digits. Therefore, most good players start a 2-player game and play exclusively on the 2P side so their score won't 'roll over' at 999,990. After the 1,000,000 mark, new Fighters are no longer awarded. [CR]What happens after finishing Stage 255 depends upon the skill level set in the DIP switches: [CR]* On the easy skill, the game resets. [CR]* On the medium skill, the game flips to "Stage 0" which plays as a strange cross between the 2nd Challenging Stage and a regular level where the enemies shoot. The game will advance to Stage 1 after completion, and the game will get easy again. [CR]* On the hard skill setting, the words "Stage 0" stay on the screen forever. No more enemies ever appear. The player can continue to move the ship and fire, but there is no way to advance to the next level, or to die. To play again, the machine must be reset. [CR]* On the hardest skill, the game flips to "Stage 0" which plays like Stage 1 (no extra enemies when flying onto the screen), but it is still as difficult as Stage 255. The game will advance to Stage 1 after completion, and the game will get easy again. [CR]If you have more than seven extra Fighters, the marker for the screen will only show 7 1/2 (!) Fighters remaining. Additional extra Fighters will still be credited, even though they won't show on the screen. [CR]In Japan, the Bees are referred to as 'Zako' and the Butterflies are referred to as 'Goei'. [CR]Stephen Krogman holds the official record for this game with 15,999,990 points. [CR]A Galaga unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', the 1983 movie 'Spring Break' (being played by one of the main characters), the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid,' the 1987 movie 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men', Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes), and was shown in 2012 movie 'The Avengers' (a agent soldier was surprised playing in the Helicarrier computer).[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Bee : 50 points in formation or 100 points in flight.[CR]Butterfly : 80 points in formation or 160 points in flight.[CR]Boss Galaga : 150 points in formation or 400 points in flight.[CR]Boss Galaga : 800 points in flight with 1 wingman.[CR]Boss Galaga : 1,600 points in flight with 2 wingmen.[CR]Scorpions : 160 points each, 1,000 points for destroying all 3.[CR]Bosconian Spy Ships : 160 points each, 2,000 points for destroying all 3.[CR]Galaxian Flagships : 160 points each, 3,000 points for destroying all 3.[CR]Captured fighter : 500 points in formation or 1000 points in flight.[CR]Challenging Stage : 100 points per ship destroyed if less than 40.[CR]Challenging Stage : 10,000 points for destroying all 40 ships (Perfect).[CR]Challenging Stage : 1,000 points on the first two Challenging Stages, 1,500 points on the 3rd and 4th, 2,000 points on the 5th and 6th, and 3,000 points from the 7th onward for destroying a complete formation of 8 ships.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Enemy Stop Shooting : on the first stage, kill everything but the two Bees in the bottom left corner. Then just wait, dodging the enemies' shots, until the enemy no longer drops any shots towards you. After the enemies stop firing, let them pass for two more trips and then kill them. For the rest of the game, the enemies will not drop shots. It will take approximately 15 minutes for the enemies to quit shooting at you, so this trick requires a lot of patience. Note : in a 2-player game, only one person has to do the cheat for both players to benefit. But as soon as one of the player's game is over the enemies begin shooting again.[CR]* (BUG) Take The Control Of The Fighter For Free : during the Galaga demo, the Boss Galaga comes down and tries to tractor-beam the Fighter. As soon as that tractor-beam starts, the player can take control of the ship in the demo. The player has two choices here and this will effect how the game handles this bug : If the player allows himself to be captured, the demo will continue as normal and he has the option of controlling the player Fighter or not. The player can choose whether to save the captured Fighter, try to complete the level, etc. The demo mode will complete after 30 seconds and the high-score screen will appear. If the player takes control of the Fighter and destroys the Boss Galaga with the tractor beam, some of the characters on the screen will freeze while others are still moving and doing what they are suppose to be doing. This will last 15-20 seconds, then the game will go to the high score screen.[CR]* Challenging stages are easier if the high score numbers are used to refine your aim. These tips assume a 6-digit high score :[CR]1) On the first two challenging stages, aim your ships so that your left set of bullets falls between the second and third numbers in the high score list.[CR]2) On subsequent challenging stages, aim one set of your bullets between the first and second numbers in the high score list (if the units come from the left) or between the last and next-to-last numbers (if the units come from the right). This will allow you to hit descending enemies at the highest possible point.[CR]* Here is a neat (and useless) Galaga trick : It is possible to end the game with a 200% ratio. The 200% hit-miss ratio trick can only be done with your first shot of the game. When the game starts, don't move, and fire only one shot. If you time it correctly, two enemies will be killed at once. Let your remaining Fighters be destroyed, and presto : a better-than-perfect result.[CR]* Easter Egg :[CR]1) Enter service mode.[CR]2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Right(x5), Left(x6), Right(x3), Left(x7). '(c) 1981 NAMCO LTD.' will be added at the bottom of the screen.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Galaxian (1979)[CR]2. Galaga (1981)[CR]3. Gaplus (1984) : also known in the USA as "Galaga 3"[CR]4.

				<plot>Galaxian (c) 1979 Namco.[CR]Galaxian is a legendary single-screen shoot-em-up that took everything that made Taito's ground-breaking "Space Invaders" so good, and improved upon it on every level. Each screen starts with a wave of multi-colored aliens moving left and right at the top of the screen; the aliens quickly break ranks and start dive-bombing the Galaxip (player's ship) - either in single units or in groups of 3 - dropping multiple missiles as they descend. All of the aliens need to be destroyed before the player can progress to the next wave. [CR]- CAST OF CHARACTERS - [CR]Galaxip : This is the name of the ship which you control at the bottom of the screen. [CR]Galaxian : These attacking aliens come in three varieties: blue, purple, and red. They begin in formation at the top of the screen and will occasionally swoop down to attack you before returning to their position in the formation. [CR]Flagship : At least two of these appear at the top of the formation at the start of each stage. They will swoop down to attack with one or two red Galaxians if any are nearby. If a flagship is one of the last enemies left of the screen, it will run away and appear as a third Flagship at the start of the next stage.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]This was the first title to use the now familiar 'Namco Cabinet', which was used for Galaxian, "Galaga", "Pac-Man", "Ms. Pac-Man". Several other titles used nearly identical cabinets as well. These machines are white, with painted sideart of a green dragonfly alien (done up in blue, green. and black). The marquee is rather large and displays a blue and green 'Galaxian' logo (which is painted on a sheet of glass, they don't make them like that anymore). The control panel and monitor bezel are not highly decorated, but do feature some game instructions. Finally this machine uses neon green t-molding (edge trim), it is difficult to find replacement trim in that same exact shade.[CR]The earliest Galaxian machines used a 25-inch G02 monitor, but later machines shipped with the standard 19-inch Electrohome G07 monitor. Any normal standard resolution arcade monitor should work as a replacement. "Pac-Man" PCBs will work in Galaxian machines, but require a 4-way joystick, instead of the 2-way model that Galaxian normally has. The sound pinout is also different, so one would need to rewire the connector to hear any Pac-Man sounds. You can also plug a Galaxian PCB into a Pac-Man. Again, the sound would need to be wired up at the connector and you'd have to push UP on the joystick to fire.[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Tone generator and discrete circuits[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-way Joystick [CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE) [CR]Alternate Japanese cabinet versions):[CR]Buttons : 3 (LEFT, RIGHT, FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Galaxian was released in October 1979 in Japan. [CR]Galaxian was the first video game to be released with 100 percent of its graphics displayed in true R.G.B. color. [CR]Space battles of all kinds played a major role during the golden age of video games. With the introduction of Galaxian, players were transported to the most colorful and challenging space battle yet.[CR]* A place in video game history : "Galaxian captivated the minds of quite a few arcade enthusiasts," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "It was a relatively early entry in the golden age of video games, and it capitalized on the enthusiasm created by the earlier video game classic, "Space Invaders", while providing a more colorful, enjoyable, and demanding gaming experience.[CR]Galaxian had smarter bad guys than "Space Invaders", and it demanded that the player really pay attention to what was going on. And there were no shields, like many games have today. You really had to stay on the ball. Galaxian also had great sound and used elements that have since become standard -- such as flags and other symbols to mark the player's progression through different levels of game play.".[CR]* The great 25-cent escape : "Galaxian definitely gets an enthusiastic response," Lindsey said. "In fact, I deliberately position the game near the entrance of the museum. Often it's the first game people go to." Lindsey often sees parents trying to convey to their child the excitement of these great games. "It is funny for me when I see a father trying to explain a game to his kid. Junior really just wants to get on the game and figure it out, and Dad wants to do a demo. Dad starts instructing Junior while Junior is sort of looking around, wondering how he can get away. But Dad continues, busily explaining the nuances of the game, which he knows Junior can't get on the first play. This all shows the enthusiasm that a certain generation still has for these terrific games."[CR]With or without a parent's help, Lindsey sees a younger generation embracing the classic arcade games. "Kids by themselves will actually do quite well on these games," Lindsey said. "I'm somewhat surprised when I see how good kids are at picking up games. I sort of think that because I'm older, I should be able to play better, and that's not always the case with video games. That's a lesson an entire generation has had to learn.".[CR]* Namco notes : Galaxian was one of Namco's first video games, and engineers throughout the company were gathered into a special team. As the game neared completion, the engineers suspected they had created a good game because other Namco employees were extremely "excited and crazy about the game." Once Galaxian was released, they knew they had a winner because, as one Namco engineer reported, "People [at the arcades] piled their coins onto the game cabinets to keep playing, and those who were waiting were very irritated because their turn never came. There were huge lines of people around each machine.".[CR]The Galaxian Flagship became a trademark of Namco as it makes cameo appearances in other Namco classics :[CR]* "Pac-Man" (1980) and "Pac-Man Plus" (1982) : The flagship makes an appearance as the bonus fruit in rounds 9 and 10, and is worth 2,000 points if Pac-Man eats it. [CR]* "Galaga" (1981) : The flagship makes an appearance as one of the "transform" ships. It splits into 2, then 3 clones of itself. They are worth 160 points each, and killing all 3 scores a bonus of 3,000 points. [CR]* "Dig Dug" (1982) : The flagship makes an appearance as the bonus vegetable in rounds 16 and 17, and is worth 7,000 points if Dig Dug picks it up. [CR]* "Super Pac-Man" (1982) : All regular edible items on rounds 15, 31, 47, and 63 are flagships, and they are worth 150 points each. Starting from their second appearance, Round 31, they are 160 points instead. [CR]* "Pac &amp; Pal" (1983) : The flagship makes an appearance as one of the "special items" that make Pac-Man turn blue when eaten, and allows him to stun the ghosts for a short while by shooting a Galaga-style tractor beam. It is worth 1,000 points if Pac-Man eats it or intercepts it from Miru. [CR]* "Pac-Land" (1984) : The ghosts in airplanes sometimes drop flagships and they are worth 7,650 points (765 being Namco's goroawase number in Japanese) if eaten. [CR]* "Super Xevious" (1984) : The flagship makes an appearance in a silver form and as an enemy, and sometimes several of them attack at once. They are worth 300 points each. [CR]* "Quester" (1987) : In Round 5, the bricks form a Galaxian Flagship.[CR]* "Pac-Mania" (1987) : The flagship makes a 3-D appearance as a special item and in two forms as well, the other one being the silver form from "Super Xevious". The regular one and the silver one are worth 7,650 points if eaten.[CR]* "Pistol Daimyo no Bouken" (1990) : The flagship makes an appearance as an enemy along with the other Galaxian characters, and they attempt to hit Pistol Daimyo with their fire. [CR]* "Tinkle Pit" (1993) : The flagship also makes an appearance with the other Galaxian characters, but this time they appear as bonus items. It is worth 800 points if collected. [CR]* "Tekken" (1994 - Arcade, 1995 - PlayStation) and "Tekken 2" (1995 - Arcade, 1996 - PlayStation) : Winning at least seven rounds in Arcade Vs. mode will reveal the Galaxian flagship on the lower left (or right) hand corner of the screen. In order for this to work, "Number of Wins Shown By" must be set to Fruit. [CR]* "Namco Classic Collection Vol.1" (1995) : The flagship makes an appearance in "Galaga Arrangement" as a Challenging Stage enemy in Space-Plant Zone (Stage 20) and normally in Space-Flower Zone (Stage 26). If killed normally, they are worth 150 points. If killed in Challenging Stage, they are worth 300 points.[CR]* "Namco Classic Collection Vol.2" (1996) : The flagship appears in both "Pac-Man Arrangement" and "Dig Dug Arrangement". In "Pac-Man Arrangement", it makes its appearance in World 4-1 and 4-2 and is worth 5,000 points if Pac-Man eats it. In "Dig Dug Arrangement", it appears in Stages 17 and 18 and is worth 7,000 points if Dig Dug picks it up.[CR]* "Pac-Man World" (1999) : The flagship appears again in a Pac-Man game. This time, the item must be collected in order to access the mazes.[CR]* "Pac-Man World 2" (2002) and "Pac-Man World 3 (2005) : The flagship teleports Pac-Man to mazes. The point value will be the same as the points earned in the maze (if completed), plus 2000.[CR]* "Namco Museum Battle Collection" (2005) : The arrangement versions of "Pac-Man" and "Dig Dug", later called "Pac-Man Remix" and "Dig Dug Remix" in the iOS version, feature the flagship. "Pac-Man Remix" features both the flagship, worth 3,200 points, and the red drone, worth 2,800 points, as fruit items, while on "Dig Dug Remix", the flagship is a vegetable item and is worth 7,000 points. [CR]"Dig Dug - Digging Strike" (2005) : Just like the first "Dig Dug", the flagship appears as a vegetable on stage 13, except it's worth 6,000 points.[CR]"Pac-Man Championship Edition" (2007) and "Pac-Man Championship Edition DX" (2010) : The flagship reappears, but is this time joined by the Galaga Boss, Queen Gaplus, and two drones, one each from "Galaga" and Galaxian.[CR]Gary Whelan holds the official record for this game with 1,114,550 points, achieved August 24, 2006 at Dukinfield in the UK.[CR]The game can be played while the main game loads in the Sony PlayStation's port of "Ridge Racer".[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The only code difference between the original Namco version and the licensed Midway version is that the 'Bonus Galaxip' text is printed on a different line.[CR]In Namco Set 2 : [CR]* Lives dip switch can be set to 3 or 5 lives. The default is 3 lives.[CR]* Extra life dip switch can be set to 4,000 (meaning a bonus Galaxip at 4,000 points), 5,000 points, 7,000 points, or None (meaning no bonus Galaxip at any time). The default is 4,000.[CR]In Midway Set 2 : [CR]* Extra life dip switch can be set to None, 3,000, 4,000, or 5,000. The default is None.[CR]In the bootleg version : [CR]* Extra life dip switch can be set to None, 20,000, 40,000, or 80,000. The default is None.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Blue Galaxian: 30 points in formation, 60 points in flight[CR]Purple Galaxian: 40 points in formation, 80 points in flight[CR]Red Galaxian: 50 points in formation, 100 points in flight[CR]Flagship: 60 points in formation, 150 points in flight[CR]Flagship: 200 points in flight with one escort[CR]Flagship: 300 points in flight with two escorts, Flagship killed before both escorts[CR]Flagship: 800 points in flight with two escorts, Flagship killed after both escorts[CR]* The maximum possible score shown is 999,990. Scores higher than this roll back to zero, but the high score will show the last score achieved before the rollover, which can vary from 999,990 to 999,200.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game. The Galaxians will be set up in formation and your Galaxip will be placed in the middle of the bottom of the screen. The action starts immediately. You can only have one shot in the air at any time so plan your shots accordingly. The game starts off slowly with only 2 or 3 Galaxians attacking your Galaxip at one time. They will drop 3 to 4 laser shots. As the waves progress, more Galaxians will come after your Galaxip until you will usually have 10-15 at any one time swooping down on it.[CR]Each wave starts out with the Galaxians in formation, in the following quantities (in order from top to bottom) :[CR]Flagships : 2 (plus any that have escaped from battle in the previous wave, up to a maximum of 4 altogether)[CR]Red Galaxians (Escorts) : 6 (in 1 row, directly below the flagships)[CR]Purple Galaxians : 8 (in 1 row, directly below the red Galaxians)[CR]Blue Galaxians : 30 (in 3 rows of 10, directly below the purple Galaxians)[CR]Flagships and red Galaxians are special enemies : they create convoys. Flagships have other special properties (see below). Purple and blue Galaxians are regular enemies.[CR]* The Galaxip can fire only shot on the screen at a time. It is possible to kill 2 enemies with one shot if they are flying extremely close to each other.[CR]* Missiles shot at the formation which miss by going between columns or near an outer edge of a column, will cause the formation to pause its left-right movement for a very short moment. This will usually, but not always, prevent missed shots near the columns from hitting the enemies in the upper rows of the formation which might otherwise be hit by moving into the shot as it flies by.[CR]* Enemies peel away from the formation and attack the Galaxip. Enemies fire at the Galaxip during their attack, but they can&#8217;t fire after they pass an invisible horizontal line just above the Galaxip.[CR]* Enemies always begin attack runs from the edges of the formation, never from the middle. This also applies to Flagships but it is not readily observable unless there are 3 or 4 Flagships present.[CR]* A 'swarm' is triggered by either of 2 criterion :[CR]1. The total number of enemies in formation is 3 or less.[CR]2. The total number of blue and purple Galaxians in formation is zero. This can occur when there are many Flagships and red Galaxians still present in formation.[CR]* When the 'swarm' starts, enemies that begin an attack do not return to formation : they keep attacking. Once started, a 'swarm' can only be ended by killing all of the enemies and/or letting them escape, or by the Galaxip getting hit. [CR]* Before the 'swarm' starts, enemies that attack, which are not killed, return to the formation. Since these enemies were on the edge of the formation and able to attack once, they are very likely to attack again soon.[CR]* When not in 'swarm', a maximum of 4 regular enemies can attack at any one time.[CR]* Flagships and convoys can attack at any time as long as another convoy attack is not already commencing; only one convoy attack can happen at a time.[CR]* A Flagship will always create a convoy with the maximum number of red escorts available to it, unless the 'swarm' has started.[CR]* The Flagships 'capture' up to 3 red escorts while they are in formation :  Whenever there is a Flagship in formation directly above an escort or above it to one side, that escort is captured and cannot attack on its own. This capture effect ends when a 'swarm' begins.[CR]* The Flagships can escape from the battle only if all three red escorts under their place in the formation have been killed. Flagships that escape will appear on the next attack wave, up to a maximum of 4 Flagships at the start of any wave.[CR]* When an attacking Flagship is killed, all enemies stop firing for a short period of time. If this kill occurs before the 'swarm', there will also be no new attacks from the formation during this period. These benefits never occur for killing a Flagship that is in formation.[CR]* The flags which count the rounds show a maximum of round 48; rounds 48 and up are shown as round 48. However if round 256 is achieved, the flags start to roll over, but with some graphical glitches; the flags that were showing round 48 begin to get overwritten, one at a time. This results in the big 10-flags being cut in half by the regular flags which start to appear, until all 4 of the 10-flags are replaced by small ones. 16 single flags show during rounds 256+8 and 256+9 (rounds 264 and 265). The glitch ends at round 256+10 (266), which shows a single 10 flag.[CR]* After wave 1, it is possible to kill any one enemy, even a Flagship, in a brand new formation by shooting at just the right time and place before the formation teleports in at the start of a new round.[CR]* The Galaxians that come down in a smooth pattern are the easiest to kill plus their shots are easy to avoid. The hard ones to kill (usually the purple Galaxians) are the ones where the Galaxian 'bounces' from side-to-side dropping shots since those shots cover a very large area.[CR]* The corners can be a death trap. When the Galaxians come down firing, their shots do not come straight down but they angle toward the direction that the Galaxian is traveling. In addition, the Galaxians have a tendency to 'charge' into the corners. You get the points if a Galaxian rams your Galaxip but you also lose your Galaxip in the process.[CR]* The Flagships are the big points in the game. Try to avoid shooting the red Galaxians since they act as escorts for the Flagship. Wait until a Flagship comes down with two escorts. If you can't get aligned to take all three out quickly, let them pass. If you do get a good angle on them, you will have to fire quickly to pick off the two escorts first, then the Flagship. If you hit the Flagship first, you get significantly less points.[CR]* Do not stop moving. If you do, you will be caught in a crossfire. The Galaxians tend to leave small areas of safety open between their shots. Also, make sure you are constantly hitting their formation to reduce their numbers (again, don't kill off the red ones).[CR]* As you progress into the higher waves, the Galaxians tend to move quicker, fly more erratic patterns, and 'gang up' on your Galaxip. Plan accordingly for this.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Galaxian (1979)[CR]2. Galaga (1981)[CR]3. Gaplus (1984) : also known in the USA as "Galaga 3"[CR]4. Galaga '88 (1987)[CR]5.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Gorf</title_clean>
				<plot>Gorf (c) 1981 Midway.[CR]The player's goal is to defeat the Gorfian Empire and safeguard the future of mankind. Gorf is a single screen shoot-em-up in the classic "Space Invaders" mould, the prime difference being that Gorf offers five distinct levels of shooting action. The levels are as follows : [CR]* Mission 1 - Astro Battles : The first mission is more or less a straight clone of "Space Invaders", set against a sky-blue background. The player is protected by a glittering parabolic forcefield, which is gradually worn away by enemy projectiles. The forcefield also works in BOTH directions, and therefore must momentarily deactivate in order for the player's ship to fire out. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the invaders. [CR]* Mission 2 - Laser Attack : The other missions are all set in space. In this mission, the player is faced with two formations each made up of five enemies. The formations are cross-shaped, and at the bottom of each formation is a single laser gun. The laser guns fire a long, dangerous yellow beam at regular intervals. At the same time, the other enemies may break formation and attempt to divebomb the player. Destroying a laser gun causes the corresponding formation to break apart. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the enemies. [CR]* Mission 3 - Galaxians : This mission is a clone of "Galaxian". The player is faced with a swarm of galaxians, which continually divebomb and shower the player with deadly projectiles. To advance to the next mission, the player must destroy all the galaxians. [CR]* Mission 4 - Space Warp : A wormhole is situated in the middle of the screen out of which enemies ships emerge, one at a time, and spiral outward at increasing speed; whilst growing larger and flinging fireballs at the player. The Space Warp level would have an influence on Konami's superb "Gyruss", released two years later. To advance to the next mission, the player must survive a number of these enemies. [CR]* Mission 5, Flag Ship : The final mission is a one-on-one confrontation with the alien Flag Ship itself. The Flag Ship is one of the earliest examples of the 'boss' enemy in mainstream video games. It is equipped with its own forcefield, through which the player must blast in order to get a clean shot on the ship. It is also armed with a powerful fireball weapon. The player's weapon has a minor effect on the Flag Ship's hull, and can only blast off tiny pieces of it. This adds to the player's problems, as stray pieces of hull can destroy their ship. These pieces can be destroyed with a single shot. The only way to destroy the Flag Ship is to hit the glowing reactor at the heart of the ship, either by first blasting away the hull to expose it, or by managing to fire a shot directly into the tiny vent that leads to the reactor. [CR]Each time the Flag Ship is destroyed, the player advances in rank. Initially, the player begins with the rank of Space Cadet, before moving on to Space Captain, Space Colonel, Space General, Space Warrior, and finally Space Avenger. The player's spaceship is equipped with a Quark Laser which allows the player to cancel a poorly aimed shot and fire another shot.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model] [No. 873][CR]Gorf upright arcade units came in a blue and grey dedicated cabinet with sticker sideart of several spaceships locked in battle.[CR]Bally Midway Astrocade hardware [CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.789773 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : (2x) Astrocade (@ 1.789773 Mhz), Votrax SC-01 [CR]Control : 8-way 'flight yolk' controller with a trigger[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in February 1981, Gorf was the first game ever to show multiple scenes. [CR]Gorf has achieved the status of 'true status' and became legendary for its groundbreaking, yet almost unintelligible speech.[CR]This game featured some early speech synthesis that was done in a similar manner to that in "Wizard of Wor" (Gorf and Wizard of Wor ran on nearly identical hardware). Here is a list of the humorous phrases Gorf says throughout the game; [rank] denotes where Gorf speaks the player's current rank :  [CR]Attract mode : [CR]1) Insert Coin![CR]2) I am the Gorfian Empire.[CR]3) Long Live Gorf![CR]NOTE : Move the controller any time during the attract mode to trigger the speech.[CR]Ready to play mode : [CR]1) Long Live Gorf![CR]2) Push a player button.[CR]Mission start-up : [CR]1) Prepare yourself for annihilation, [rank]![CR]2) You will meet a Gorfian doom, [rank]![CR]3) Survival is impossible, [rank]![CR]4) You cannot escape the Gorfian robots![CR]5) I am the Gorfian Empire![CR]6) I am a Gorfian consciousness.[CR]7) Gorfian robots...Attack! Attack![CR]8) Robot warriors, seek and destroy the [rank]![CR]9) My Gorfian robots are unbeatable![CR]10) Gorfians take no prisoners![CR]Player loses a ship : [CR]1) Got you, [rank]![CR]2) Bad move, [rank]![CR]3) Some galactic defender you are, [rank]![CR]4) Another enemy ship destroyed![CR]5) Your end draws near, [rank]![CR]6) Ha ha ha ha![CR]Player loses last ship : [CR]1) Too bad, [rank]![CR]2) Bite the dust, [rank]![CR]At game over : [CR]1) Gorfians conquer another galaxy.[CR]2) You cannot escape the Gorfian Robots.[CR]3) All hail the supreme Gorfian Empire![CR]4) Try again; I devour coins![CR]Player destroys Flag Ship (and advances in rank; [new rank] denotes where Gorf speaks the player's new rank) : [CR]1) Nice shot! You have been promoted to [new rank]![CR]2) For hitting my Flag Ship, you have been promoted to [new rank]![CR]3) In the Gorfian chronicals, you have been promoted to [new rank]![CR]4) Next time will be harder, but for now you have been promoted to [new rank]![CR]NOTES : These phrases may not be easy to hear over the loud explosion of the Flag Ship. The Rank lamp on the bezel moves over to the next rank as soon as Gorf begins speaking.[CR]OTHER NOTES :  [CR]Have you ever noticed that GORF is FROG spelled backwards? Seriously, GORF is an acronym for 'Galactic Orbital Robot Force'.[CR]The game's creator, Jay Fenton, designed a sequel to Gorf called 'Ms. Gorf', but it was never released. Jay Fenton underwent a sex change and is now known as Jamie Fenton. [CR]A Star Trek tie in was originally planned by Midway, but when the first movie fell flat, the Enterprise sprite was reused as the Gorf Flag Ship. [CR]Todd Rogers holds the official record for this game with 653990 points. [CR]A Gorf unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' and in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'. [CR]An upright Gorf unit appears in the 38 Special music video 'Caught Up In You'.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Astro Battle : [CR]Space Invaders (all) : 50 points[CR]Destroying Gorfian robot distributing Space Invaders : 300 points[CR]Mystery Saucer : 100 points[CR]Back and Forth Saucer : 300 points[CR]NOTE : If you hit a Space Invader when it is being launched from the Gorfian robot, you get 100 points.[CR]Laser Attack : [CR]Laser Ships : 300 points[CR]Escorts for Laser Ships : 100 points[CR]Galaxians : [CR]All Galaxians not attacking : 50 points[CR]Yellow Galaxian attacking : 60 points[CR]Blue Galaxian attacking : 80 points[CR]Red Galaxian attacking : 100 points[CR]Galaxian Flagship : 300 points[CR]Space Warp : [CR]Enemy fighters : 100 points[CR]Flag Ship :[CR]Each hit : 20 points[CR]Escorts : 100 points[CR]Destroying a piece of debris : 150 points[CR]Destroying Flag Ship (and advancing in rank) : 1000 points[CR]Gorfian robots (appear randomly) : 300 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game. The first sight that will greet you are the Space Invaders. From that point on, the action will be non-stop with the only things changing are your rank and the difficulty of the enemies. Also, there is an interesting quirk in the game. If your ship hits a displayed score (after destroying some enemy), your ship will be destroyed. So avoid flying into scores. Also, you can only have one shot up at a time. This, though, can be countered by the fact that you can prematurely end a shot and fire another thus saving yourself a lot of time and perhaps your ship. [CR]* Due to Gorf's limited hardware not being powerful enough to move the game's colourful sprites around easily, it's possible, on the Astro Battles screen, to slow the last two invaders down to a crawl; simply by repeatedly firing. On the Laser Attack screen, if you shoot all the enemy ships EXCEPT for the laser shooters, you can sit forever on the far left hand side of the screen. Useless, but interesting all the same. [CR]* Astro Battles : [CR]1) Fire immediately when the mission starts. You may get lucky and hit the Gorfian robot distributing the Space Invaders. Also fire at the invaders as they are being distributed for more points. [CR]2) Instead of the normal 11x5 grid of invaders, you only have to deal with an 8x3 grid. [CR]3) Instead of buildings to protect your ship, you now have a shield dome over you. It briefly disappears when you fire, but the invaders have to cut through it with their lasers. [CR]4) Remember, you have a lot of maneuverability in your ship (i.e. you can go up and down) so it should be easy to avoid the invaders bombs. [CR]* Laser Attack : [CR]1) Your first priority should be the laser ships. Wait until they have fired and send a shot right up their laser cannon. [CR]2) The escorts tend to make random movements so be wary of them coming at you from all directions. [CR]3) As you advance higher in rank, everything speeds up accordingly. [CR]* Galaxians : [CR]1) Try to shoot the Galaxians when they are setting up to get the score for attacking Galaxians. [CR]2) At first, only a couple will come down. After a while, though, the Galaxians attempt to swarm all over your ship. Since they each fire three shots apiece, this can present a particularly deadly situation. [CR]3) Keep moving. There is no safe place (not even the corners). [CR]4) At later ranks, it isn't uncommon for a whole bunch of Galaxians to attack your ship at once. [CR]5) If you can, try to hit the Gorfian robot that sometimes bounds over the top of the Galaxians. [CR]* Space Warp : [CR]1) This is the mission that tends to kill off most players. You will see a black hole with dots in it. These dots represent the number of fighters you have to deal with coming out of the black hole. As a Space Cadet, you only deal with 12 fighters. From Space Captain onward, it will be 16 fighters. [CR]2) Fighters leave fast or slow and rotate around the hole. In addition, they will also fire at you. It will take some fancy maneuvering to avoid both the fighter and the shot it fired. [CR]3) Some fighters go around so fast, you just have to try to keep out of its way. [CR]4) Sometimes fighters will launch a slow shot from the side of the screen. Watch out for these shots. [CR]5) In the later ranks, it will take all of your skill to survive since everything moves very quickly on this mission. [CR]* Flag Ship : [CR]1) The Flag Ship will fly back and forth slowly. It will descend then ascend as it completes a back and forth movement. [CR]2) There is a shield around the Flag Ship you must cut through to hit it. The Flag Ship can fire through the shield at you. [CR]3) On the later ranks (starting with Space Captain), the Flag Ship is escorted by two Gorfian robots. [CR]4) Plan your shots so you can expose the reactor. This will mean cutting through a little bit of the ship to accomplish this. Watch out for the debris you create since it is as deadly as the Flag Ship's laser shots. If you feel really daring, hit the debris for extra points. [CR]5) After you have stripped the ship away from the reactor, a well-placed shot should obliterate the Flag Ship. [CR]6) Again, in the later ranks everything moves much faster.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Gorf (1981)[CR]2.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Gyruss</title_clean>
				<plot>Gyruss (c) 1983 Konami Industry Company, Limited.[CR]Gyruss is a single player shoot-em-up in which the purpose is to fly through the solar system, destroying waves of alien attackers, before finally reaching Earth. Planets that must be passed before Earth is reached are Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. [CR]It only takes two warps to reach Neptune, but all of the others, including Earth, take three warps to get to. Each time the player reaches a planet, they will be faced with a 'Chance Stage', a bonus stage in which players try to destroy as many aliens as possible to accrue points. After reaching Earth, there is a Chance Stage, followed by a very fast '3 Warps to Neptune' stage. After this, the levels and the background music start over. [CR]Gyruss' superb gameplay, in which the player ship rotates around the edges of the screen and fires 'inwards', is heavily influenced by Atari's 1981 classic, "Tempest". While the design of the alien ships themselves is similar to those of Namco's also-legendary "Galaga" series.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX347[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz), M6809 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), I8039 (@ 533.333 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : (5x) AY8910 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), DAC, (6x) RC (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2 (alternative)[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 1[CR]=&gt; Fire[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Gyruss was released in March 1983. Also licensed to Centuri for US manufacture and distribution (April 1983). [CR]After working on the successful "Time Pilot", Gyruss' designer, Yoshiki Okamoto, went on to create Gyruss, which, although a success in its own right, was released at a time when the arcade craze was starting to die down. This may explain why the game didn't shift the units it really deserved. After its release, Okamoto asked for a raise, or he would quit. He was duly fired when he turned up for work the following day. [CR]One of the most memorable features of this game is its soundtrack, which consists of an extremely catchy synthesized rendition of Bach's 'Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor'. [CR]Anthony Fodrizio holds the official record for this game with 41090450 points. [CR]A set of developer credits are hidden in the ROM, beginning at 1E9A in memory.[CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Venus". [CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-85) on June 25, 1986.[CR]A Gyruss unit appears in the music video for "Kid Candy" by the grunge rock group Seaweed.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Shooting a ship : 50, 100 or 150 points. [CR]Destroying a whole formation of enemy ships before the next wave attacks : 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 points. [CR]Bonus for clearing a sector (having not destroyed a whole formation) : 1000 points. [CR]Shooting the three glowing spheres : 1000, 1500, 2000 points. [CR]Bonus for shooting each ship on the Chance Stage : 100 points. [CR]Bonus for shooting all 40 ships on the Chance Stage : 10000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* You can get double fire if you shoot the sun-like enemy that appears in front of you surrounded by two blue pod-like enemies - try to make this a priority.[CR]* To make getting double fire easier, try to stay at the bottom of the screen until the 'pod and sun' formation appears as it will appear right in front of wherever your ship is after all enemies have entered and they start attacking. [CR]1) There must be at least three enemies left in the level for the 'pod and sun' formation to show. If you lose a life and three enemies are left, the 'pod and sun' will show up one more time, but if you lose a life after that, they will not show any more until the next level. After you get double fire, the sun enemy will be replaced on later levels with another pod. Destroy all three for some bonus points.[CR]2) If you have only one enemy left and cannot seem to destroy it, just leave it alone and eventually it will just leave and the level will end.[CR]* Each level begins with four formations entering. If you destroy enough of these, a fifth formation will enter. As you pass each planet, more formations will enter towards the top of the screen. Learn to control your ship at the top as it will come in real handy on those Mars and Earth warps.[CR]* When formations enter from the edge of the screen, they will not hit you if you are right where they enter. You can use this to your advantage to take out the formation with little or no trouble - just watch out for asteroids.[CR]* Asteroids will always appear in your path - they cannot be destroyed and must be avoided.[CR]* The 'bee-like' creatures with the force field will always appear from the center and move outward.

				<plot>Space Invaders (c) 1978 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]Export version manufactured by Midway under license from Taito. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Taito upright model entry; "Space Invaders".[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 739[CR][Upright model][CR]Buttons : 3 (LEFT, RIGHT, FIRE)[CR](The US upright model had no joystick)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Space Invaders by Midway was released in October 1978 in the USA.[CR]The Space Invaders phenomenon stunned many conservative adults of the time who were convinced that video-games soured the minds of their youngsters. Residents of Mesquite, Texas, pushed the issue all the way to the Supreme Court in their efforts to ban the illicit machines from their Bible-belt community. A number of reported incidents of juvenile crime began to surface shortly after the game's release, adding to its 'controversy'. A girl was caught stealing $5,000 from her parents and gangs of youths were reported to have robbed grocery stores just so they would have money to play the game.[CR]Of the reported 350,000 units produced world wide, about 65,000 units were produced in the U.S. alone.[CR]Technology journalist Jason Whittaker credited the game's success to ending the video game crash of 1977, which had earlier been caused by Pong clones flooding the market, and beginning the golden age of video arcade games. According to The Observer, the home console versions were popular and encouraged users to learn programming; many who later became industry leaders.[CR]Space Invaders inspired a catchy hit song by 'Uncle Vic' called 'Space Invaders' released over the spring to summer-time period of 1980. The Pretenders also released an instrumental song called 'Space Invaders' on their debut album in 1980.[CR]A Space Invaders unit appears in the 1980 movie 'Midnight Madness', in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll &amp; Hyde... Together Again', in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'The Iceman', in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day', and in the 1998 sitcom 'That 70's Show'; Season 4, Episode 8 (Donna's Story).[CR]An upright unit of the Midway release of Space Invaders appears in the ZZ Top music video, 'Legs'.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Journey (c) 1983 Bally Midway.[CR]The Play mode begins when either the 1-PLAYER or the 2-PLAYER START button is pressed. The Play mode ends when all of your performers have been eliminated. When this happens, GAME OVER is written across the center of the monitor screen.[CR]ON THE SCREEN : The game is made up of groups of 5 sequences for each rack. When play begins, all the performers run onto the screen and jump aboard their transport ship, the Scarab. The Scarab then lifts off and heads for a point in space that is at the center of a grouping of five planets. (The song that is played in the background during this scene is 'Lights'.) Each group member's instrument is on a different planet.[CR]At the beginning of each sequence, when a 2-PLAYER game has been selected, the game tells which player is up.[CR]Also indicated in each sequence of each rack is the number of players (1 or 2), a running total of the player score(s), and the highest game score to date.[CR]PLAY BEGINS : From this point, the player has approximately 10 seconds to decide which planet he wants to take the Scarab to (which performer&#8217;s instrument he wants to retrieve). The Scarab is guided to the planet of your choice by using the control stick to direct its movement.[CR]OBSTACLES : On each planet there are various obstacles that must be overcome in order for that particular performer to retrieve his instrument and make his way back to the Scarab.[CR]1st PLANET - Microphone : Steve Perry must pass between the turnstiles without touching them, get his microphone, and shoot his way back to the Scarab. The background song for this scene is 'Don't Stop Believing'.[CR]2nd PLANET - Bass : Here, Ross Valory must leap onto the elevating pedestals, timing his assent to grab his bass as it passes by him at the top of the screen, and shoot his way back to the Scarab. The song played in the background here is 'Keep On Running'.[CR]3rd PLANET - Keyboard : Here, Jonathan Cain must leap the moving conveyor belt ridges without being touched to reach his keyboard and then must shoot his way back to the Scarab. The background song here is 'Stone in Love'.[CR]4th PLANET - Guitar : With his jet pack, Neal Schon must traverse the dangerous passages in this cavern to finally retrieve his guitar and then fight his way back to the Scarab. 'Chain Reaction' plays in the background here.[CR]5th PLANET - Drums : Steve Smith must jump from drum-head to drum-head, landing on all of them at least once in order to reach his drums. He then must shoot his way back to the Scarab. 'Wheel in the Sky' is the background song here.[CR]ALL INSTRUMENTS RETRIEVED : All the performers now move to a stage and give a performance of 'Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)', their latest hit blockbuster at the time of this game's release. They will play as long as Herbie, the bouncer (controlled by the player), can keep the excited fans from overrunning the stage. When this happens, play starts all over again in the next rack which will be more difficult to complete. The performers all have to retrieve their instruments again.[CR]SEQUENCES : Play ends in any particular sequence when one of 3 things happens.[CR]a. The performer has a mishap and, except for Steve Perry, falls to the bottom of the screen. (A sample of 'Who's Crying Now' will play in the background.)[CR]b. The performer retrieves his instrument and shoots his way back to the Scarab.[CR]c. The excited fans storm the stage (play advances to the next rack of 5 sequences).[CR]PERFORMERS : When on each of the 5 planets, the performer's movements are controlled by the control stick on the games control panel. They can basically move in any direction.[CR]MISHAP : Play will begin again (if you have reserve performers left) in space, all performers are in the Scarab, and the player has approximately 10 seconds to pick the next planet he wants to try.[CR]NOTE : You cannot pick a planet where the performer has already retrieved his instrument. These planets are indicated to the player by a wavey white ring around them.[CR]If there are no more reserve performers left, GAME OVER is written across the screen.[CR]SCARAB VEHICLE : The Scarab can move in any direction on the screen. Its movements are controlled by the control stick on the games control panel.[CR]FIRE CONTROL BUTTONS : These control the rate of fire of your performer in; either left, right, up, or down directions (certain performers can only fire in certain directions). There are 2-fire control buttons on the Upright models to allow both left and right handed persons to play the game easily.[CR]CONTROL STICK : By using the control stick you can position the Scarab/performer/bouncer at any location you desire on the screen.[CR]BONUS PERFORMERS : These can be awarded to the player as he reaches or passes certain preselected point values. This feature is adjustable by the game's owner/operator.[CR]GAME ENDS : When your last performer is eliminated.

The machine contained a tape loop of the song 'Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)' in the concert scene at the end of each level. Rushed through the 1982 Christmas holidays by the Marvin Glass &amp; Associates because Bally/Midway wanted the game to coincide with the release of the band's Frontiers album. They took all the images of the band backstage at a Salt Lake City concert. There was talk of using the game as part of the road show, but that fell through.[CR]The story about the idea of players being able to take photos of their own face being dropped due to their taking pictures of certain body parts did not occur with this game, but with an earlier prototype called Clone. That game was dropped but when Baer heard about Journey, he saw a new opportunity to use his digitizing camera technology.[CR]The background music includes the Journey songs : 'Chain Reaction', 'Don't Stop Believin', 'Lights', 'Keep On Running', 'Stone In Love' and 'Wheel In The Sky'. A mishap on a planet will result in the playing of a small sample of 'Who's Crying Now'.[CR]Outside of this game, the Scarab vehicle appears in the front cover of the band's 'Escape' album, released in 1981.[CR]The giant head that appears in the attract mode's title sequence (and the Scarab flies into at the beginning of the game) is from the front cover of the band's 'Frontiers' album, released in 1983 (the same year this game was released).[CR]The logo on the marquee is the same logo as on the front of the 'Frontiers' album. This logo is identical to that of the Magnavox Odyssey2 video game console released in 1978.[CR]The side art is also the same image as the front cover of the 'Frontiers' album, with logo and giant head together.[CR]Joe Maurizi holds the official record for this game with 10,000,125 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Secret screen : on Journey's attract screen (the one with the giant head), press all the buttons (Blast, 1P Start, 2P Start) and the joystick to the Left and you'll get a screen with the programmer's names and tiny digitized pictures.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Designed and programmed by : Elaine Ditton, Richard Ditton (founders of Incredible Technologies).[CR]Graphics by : Scott Morrison[CR]Sounds : Elaine Ditton, Steve Meyer[CR]Hardware : Cary Mednick, Robert Ploussard, Ashok Charles[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Joust 2 - Survival of the Fittest (c) 1986 Williams Electronics, Incorporated.[CR]On the planet of the floating cliffs, society calls upon its wing-mounted Gladiators to solve conflicts. You, the Gladiator, must enter the fray, participating in a challenge of honor, a Joust... where only the fittest survive! [CR]The legend of "Joust" continues in Joust 2. Players must solve the puzzle of what strategy will be most effective in dealing with the buzzards and other winged enemies on each of Joust 2's 35 different backgrounds. [CR]The object of Joust 2 is to defeat all winged enemies by colliding with them. To survive a collision (joust), the Gladiator's lance must be higher. [CR]Defeating a Buzzard Enemy in a Joust causes release of an Egg. Eggs may be caught in the air or collected on landing areas for bonus points. Be Careful! Eggs falling into the Lava form into aggressive mutants, while uncollected Eggs hatch into dangerous warriors. [CR]Danger lurks everywhere! Giant Statues come to life; Bats fall out of crystals embedded in the rocks; Lava Trolls and Water Monsters eat unsuspecting bird-mounts; Lightning fills the air; and Unbeatable? Pterodactyls patrol the skies. A gigantic Knight presides on several waves. You, the Gladiator, must destroy him! Hitting all four of his red pins explodes the Knight and all his servants. [CR]Gold Egg Feature : A Gold Egg may randomly appear on any wave. Collecting the Gold Egg before it hatches opens a window of awards in the background. To collect an award, step on the red button above the window before a timer expires. Both players reap the benefits of the posted award, which may include bonuses of 1,000 to 10,000 points, 'super zapping' all enemies on the screen, or even receiving an extra life. [CR]Prepare thyself for War! [CR]Buy-In : Joust 2 is designed for action entertainment for one or two simultaneous players. Players who have started the game may continue where they left off by using the buy-in feature. When a player has used all of his lives, he will hear : "Wish to continue?" A 10-second timer appears in the players score area to allow the game to continue by using a Credit, or inserting a coin, before the player presses the Start button. [CR]Level Selection : At the beginning of a game, the player selects, via the Flap button, one of six different waves, corresponding to the player's skill level. Then, pressing the Start button begins the game. If the player wins the starting wave, he receives an award of points, approximating the scoring from preceding waves.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]This game uses a redesign of the 'Williams Classic' platform. It is not compatible with the older titles, but they could possibly run on this platform with a little bit of tweaking. The game is contained on a set of two PCB boards, and a third board does audio duties. This title was released in an upright dedicated cabinet that was very similar in design to the original "Joust" cabinet (you would have to set them side by side to be able to spot the differences). It is decorated with stencil style painted side-art of a knight riding on a large bird (this was one of the last games to have stenciled side-art, stickers and other painting methods had been the norm for several years). The rest of the cabinet artwork is all based on the original "Joust" artwork, but has much more detail. The biggest difference between this cabinet and an original "Joust" cabinet is that this game uses a vertical monitor, rather than a horizontal one.

[CR]This year, the arcade industry was in a big slump, the golden age had been over for a few years, and the brief revival of the late 80s had not yet begun. Williams decided to do a sequel to their classic Joust title, and came up with Joust 2 - Survival of the Fittest. This was a complete update to the original with new enemies and a variety of different levels, but it had one little flaw, it just simply was not as fun as the original. It was a great game on its own, but not when compared to "Joust". They only ended up making about 1,000 of these, and most of them saw little action on the arcade floor. The players seemed to prefer the original "Joust" (which most arcades still had back then). Most of these machines ended up being pulled from the arcades after only a few months, and have survived to the present day in excellent conditions (It seems they were pulled for lack of profits, but most of them were not converted, because by 1986 most operators had a whole warehouse full of games to convert, and would usually select an older title rather than a new one that they could possibly sell off to someone else). [CR]Dwayne Richard holds the official record for this game with 2,655,600 points.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Joust (1982)[CR]2.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Jr. Pac-Man</title_clean>
				<plot>Jr. Pac-Man (c) 1983 Bally Midway.[CR]One of many sequels to the legendary "Pac-Man", Jr. Pac-Man features the character of Pac-Man's son. For the first time in the series' history, side-scrolling mazes were introduced, with each maze being two screens wide. [CR]This time, the mazes have no exit tunnels through which players can make an escape. The bonus items that appear move around the maze and are now something of a mixed blessing, as not only will they destroy any Power Pills they come across, but they will also turn any normal dots they pass over into large dots that slow the player's movements considerably, but are worth more points than normal dots if eaten by the player. Any mutated dots in the maze will disappear if the player loses a life. [CR]The Pac character is once again pursued by four ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Tim) in his quest to eat all of the dots in each maze. And, as before, numerous Power Pills litter the mazes that, when eaten, allow Jr. to eat the pursuing ghosts. [CR]As with previous "Pac-Man" games, intermissions are featured between certain levels. Jr. Pac-Man's intermissions are episodic in nature, like those found in "Ms. Pac-Man". Jr. Pac-Man's story tells of the blossoming love between Jr. Pac-Man and a small ghost named Yum-Yum. [CR]Act I - Jr. Meets Yum-Yum : Jr. Pac-Man steps outside his home to play. He spots Yum-Yum beyond the fence in his yard and goes outside to meet her. Blinky, hiding in the shadows, comes out from hiding to catch Jr. However Ms. Pac-Man, keeping a watchful eye over her child, sees the commotion from her window and runs out to the yard to eat a Power Pill and chase both ghosts away while Jr. returns to the safety of home. This intermission is played after Round 1. [CR]Act II - The Gift : It seems that Jr. can't get the enchanting young ghost out of his mind, so he proceeds to bring a balloon to her as a gift the next day. Excited to see her, he meets her on a bridge and hands her the balloon, when we catch a glimpse of Blinky lurking behind a bush. This intermission is played after Round 3. [CR]Act III - They Escape : Blinky moves from one bush to the another, startling Yum-Yum into releasing the balloon. Blinky attempts to capture Jr. once and for all, but once again, Ms. Pac-Man comes to the rescue. Blinky chases her off to the left, while Jr. Pac-Man and Yum-Yum escape to the right. Once alone, they gaze in to each other's eyes and fall in love, with hearts appearing all around them. This intermission is played after Rounds 5, 7, and 9.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Game No. 0A29][CR]Game was available either as one of 2 kits to update a "Pac-Man" upright cabinet or cocktail table cabinet. It was also available as a dedicated game using a "Mappy"-style cabinet.[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG (@ 96 Khz)[CR]Screen orientation : Vertical[CR]Video resolution : 224 x 288 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.61 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 16[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Jr. Pac-Man was released in October 1983.[CR]Jr. Pac-Man was developed by 'General Computer Corporation' (GCC) for Bally/Midway and is essentially an enhancement to "Ms. Pac-Man" (which is, in itself, an enhanced version of the original "Pac-Man"). Much of the original "Pac-Man" code is still present and even the 'GENERAL COMPUTER CORPORATION Hello, Nakamura.' message that featured in "Ms. Pac-Man" is present.[CR]Jr. Pac-Man runs on a modified "Pac-Man" hardware, with additional horizontal scrolling support. This was the first "Pac-Man" game in which the maze is larger than the visible area; requiring the screen to scroll.[CR]There are a number of hidden bonus objects that were never used by the developers. To see them, set 'CHEATS' to 'Always have blue ghosts'; play a game, repeatedly eat the ghosts until you get past 1600 points. The game was coded to deal with such high bonus values and assigns a hexadecimal value to the score value after 1600. The hexadecimal scores equate to a graphic in the game. After eating somewhere in the neighborhood of 20-30 ghosts consecutively, the hidden objects will appear. There is a rattle, a baby's dummy, a cowboy hat and a skateboard.[CR]Abner Ashman holds the official record for this game with 1500000 points on February 2, 2002. In the game where he "officially" got this record, there was a power outage that shut down his game at approximately that score... and he still had not lost a man up to that point![CR]A bootleg of this game runs on the "Pengo" hardware.[CR]A Jr. Pac-Man unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Dot : 10 points.[CR]Mutated Dot : 50 points.[CR]Powerpill : 50 points.[CR]Ghosts : 200, 400, 800 and 1600 points.[CR]Cycle : 100 points.[CR]Kite : 200 points.[CR]Drum : 500 points.[CR]Balloon : 700 points.[CR]Train : 1000 points.[CR]Cat : 2000 points.[CR]Beer! : 5000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]MAZE STRATEGY[CR]The first maze, which has 548 dots and six Power Pills, offers a good mix of straight-a-ways and islands. The two power pills on either side of the ghosts' den cannot be destroyed by bonuses, so try to save them for later in the stage. The ghosts move slow enough that you can plan out your strategy and wait by power pills for ghosts to gather nearby before eating them. [CR]The second maze has 560 dots, six Power Pills, and features more long stretches than the first maze, but there are many escape routes, so you shouldn't worry about getting trapped. Use the 'staircase' section of the maze on the far ends to put distance between you and any trailing ghosts. It's possible to 'trap' the ghosts so that you can complete a lot of the maze without them chasing you. Position Jr. to either the far left or far right hand side of the maze; thus causing the center of the maze to scroll off-screen. You should see the ghosts in the corridors above the ghosts' den; they will stay in those corridors as long as you are on either the left or right hand side of the maze. This works because the game has logic to reverse the ghosts' direction when they go off screen.[CR]The third maze has 526 dots, six Power Pills, and features small circular sections that you should approach with caution. It can be hard to read which directions the ghosts will move in around them and lead to unavoidable collisions. By this maze, the ghosts are speeding up, so take the time to cross from one section of the maze to the other to prevent the ghosts from surrounding you. [CR]The fourth maze has 526 dots, six Power Pills, and features islands on the bottom that can be both helpful and harmful. They allow you multiple paths to take in order to escape from one ghost, but they also provide multiple pathways for a number of ghosts to surround you. Clear as much of the bottom sections as you can before you eat the Power Pill. Then use the Pill and eat any ghost in the area before time runs out. Then finish the section if possible before moving on. [CR]The fifth maze has 528 dots, six Power Pills, and features islands that are scattered throughout. Cross back and forth across the entire maze to prevent the ghosts from ganging up on you in any one section of the maze. Power pills are becoming less effective at this point. Don't sacrifice yourself trying to stop a bonus item from destroying a power pill. [CR]The sixth maze has many S-turns that offer the ghosts multiple opportunities to trap you from either end. Keep the ghosts behind you by crossing back and forth. To make matters worse, you only get four Power Pills instead of six. Aside from the Power Pills, there are a total of 512 dots in this maze. Don't let the bonus item transform too many of the dots into mutated dots in this maze, or you will have a harder time avoiding ghosts while being slowed down by the large dots. [CR]The seventh and final maze is by far the most dangerous maze to Jr.'s survival. The center is relatively safe, but the sides of the maze are deadly. There are 540 dots and only four Power Pills in this maze. The Power Pills are situated in odd corners. The far path around the outside of the maze is considerably dangerous as it is easy to get trapped trying to clear it. And the Power Pills simply aren't effective long enough to keep you safe. The smaller sections between the side Power Pills is also easy to become trapped in. Only enter if the coast looks clear, and make sure that you have an exit strategy if a ghost decides to enter this small section with you. For all of your planning, success in this maze depends on a considerable amount of luck.[CR]After you finish the seventh maze, the mazes cycle from the fourth through the seventh in a repeating loop.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Kangaroo (c) 1982 Sun Electronics.[CR]A platform game in which the player controls a mother Kangaroo who must climb through the treetops trying to rescue her captured son. Numerous monkeys, the kidnappers of her child, roam the levels set on stopping the player's progress. The monkeys constantly throw apples at the Kangaroo which must either be avoided (either by ducking or jumping, depending on the height of the approaching apple), or punched away, the latter of which allows the Kangaroo to punch the apple back towards the attacking monkey.[CR]If the player stalls for too long or does not punch either an apple or a monkey, a giant ape will appear and steal the Kangaroo's boxing gloves, leaving the player temporarily defenseless. The gloves are returned after a short time.[CR]Fruit and vegetables litter the levels and can be picked up for bonus points. Each level also has a bell hanging from one of its platforms, which can be punched to make fruit and vegetable items appear.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Krull</title_clean>
				<plot>Krull (c) 1983 Gottlieb.[CR]The left joystick controls the movement of the player character, Colwyn. He can be moved in any one of eight directions. The right joystick controls the movement of the player's weapon, the glaive. It can be thrown in any one of eight directions. Four glaives can be in flight at one time and will return to Colwyn with a boomerang-type action. The one and two player select buttons are also located on the panel.[CR]Krull consists of five subgames :[CR]1. The Mountain Game.[CR]2. The Swamp Game.[CR]3. The Fortress Game.[CR]4. The Hexagon Game.[CR]5. The Beast Game.[CR]The player must accomplish a task in each of the five games with eight levels of difficulty in each. All eight levels can be reached in one task based on the time spent performing that task (amount of time spent on that subgame). The total number of lethal characters on the screen at one time increases as the levels increase.[CR]FROM THE SKY WILL COME THE BLACK FORTRESS. FROM THE FORTRESS WILL COME THE SLAYERS, TO DEVOUR THE PLANET OF KRULL. THEN SHALL A GIRL OF ANCIENT NAME BECOME QUEEN, AND THE KING SHE CHOOSES SHALL RULE THE PLANET.[CR]The planet Krull is threatened by the Beast. His army of Slayers has brought terror to the land. Colwyn must stop this terror and save the land and its people. On the day Colwyn is to wed the Princess Lyssa, the Slayers, army of the Beast, kidnap her to become the Beast's bride. Colwyn must reach the Black Fortress and reclaim his Princess. He who marries the Princess shall be king. The Beast must not be allowed to rule the planet.[CR]A prophet acquaints Colwyn with the magical properties of the glaive, a five-bladed sword, which Colwyn must acquire. To accomplish this task, he must climb the mountain and collect the five individual blades of the glaive in order to assemble the weapon. The blade is picked up by touching Colwyn to the blade. Boulders are fatal and must be avoided. The weapon joystick is not utilized in this subgame. The player is awarded 1,000 points for each blade picked up. Points are also awarded for placing Colwyn in a dangerous position in front of one or more boulders.[CR]During his travels to discover the Black Fortress, Colwyn comes upon an army of eight men that he befriends and recruits to help him in his quest to destroy the Beast so that Krull can be safe from his evil.[CR]With no intentions of losing his newly acquired bride without bloodshed, the Beast orders an army of Slayers to stop Colwyn and his friends. Forging through the quicksand-riddled swamps, Slayers materialize from the soil and Colwyn prepares for battle. In the second subgame, Colwyn must save as many friends as possible while killing all of the Slayers. The friends are saved by touching them and the Slayers are destroyed by the glaive. The Slayers themselves and their spears must be avoided. The game begins with eight friends. The number of friends saved is the number of friends carried over into future subgames. The friends can eliminate the Slayers with hand-to-hand combat but can also be destroyed themselves. Receiving three blows either by hand-to-hand or by the Slayers spear is fatal to the friends. The subgame ends when there are no longer any friends to save and all of the Slayers have been eliminated. Avoid quicksand, as it slows Colwyn's attack. Each friend saved awards 1,000 points (maximum 8,000 points) and 100 points for each Slayer the player eliminates.[CR]After days of travel, Colwyn and his men have found the Black Fortress in the Iron Desert where many dangers await them. While attempting to lead his men through the dangerous narrow passageways that lead to the Fortress, Slayers materialize once again in a second attempt to stop Colwyn's struggle. In this third subgame, Colwyn must pick up all of his friends and deposit them safely into the hexagon while again combating the Slayers. The total number of friends in this subgame is equal to the total number of friends saved in Subgame 2. This subgame concludes when all of the friends have been delivered to the hexagon. The player is awarded 1,000 points for each friend delivered to the hexagon, 100 points for each Slayer he destroys and 100 points for each Slayer remaining when the last friend is delivered to the hexagon.[CR]Victorious in battle, Colwyn must now attempt to release his friends from the hexagon. Unlike entry, exiting the hexagon is a struggle deservant of its own merit. Once again Colwyn must call upon the power of the glaive. Release of his friends is accomplished by throwing the glaive at the front wall while it is black only. Any glaive striking the wall while it is not black will stick in the wall until the wall becomes black. The Slayers, of course, attempt to stop Colwyn's efforts. In his own attempt for survival, Colwyn must fight them off and avoid their spears. The subgame ends when the last black wall is broken through and the friends have escaped. The player is awarded 100 points for each Slayer he puts an end to, 100 points for each Slayer remaining when the friends are set free and 1,000 points for the first black wall destroyed, 2,000 points for the second, 3,000 points for the third and 4,000 points for the fourth.[CR]Now inside the Black Fortress, Colwyn secedes from his friends in order to rescue the Princess Lyssa. He finds her in a large cave carefully guarded by the Beast. He knows that the only way to reclaim his bride and conserve the planet is to forge into battle with the Beast. In the fifth subgame, the player moves Colwyn towards the Princess in order to reach her. As he progresses, the Beast attempts to stop him by throwing fireballs at him. The fireballs must be avoided or destroyed by the glaive. If not destroyed, the fireballs will ricochet off of the walls. Destroying a fireball awards the player 100 points multiplied by the number of fireballs in flight. The Beast is momentarily stunned when hit with a glaive and awards the player 100 points. The Beast cannot be destroyed and the player must avoid touching him. When Colwyn reaches the Princess, his friends, following the pandemonium of the battle, appear and chase the Beast off, awarding 1000 points per friend. The total number of friends in this subgame is equal to the total number of friends saved in Subgame 2.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GV-105[CR]Main CPU : I8086 (@ 5 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 894.886 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : DAC[CR]Screen orientation : Vertical[CR]Palette colors : 16[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : Double 8-way joysticks[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Krull was released in March 1983.[CR]this game is known in Japan as "Ginga Densetsu Krull" (translates from Japanese as 'Galactic Legend Krull').[CR]Krull was designed and programmed in 10 months.

To create this special-effect epic, Columbia Pictures has assembled the industry's top talent, people who helped bring Superman and The Empire Strikes Back to the screen.

				<plot>Lady Bug (c) 1981 Universal.[CR]In Lady Bug you guide a lady bug through a Pac-Man style maze, eating dots, and avoiding enemy insects. You lose a life if you run into a skull or get eaten by an enemy insect. Collect letters to spell EXTRA for a bonus life (just like in Mr. Do!), and SPECIAL for an extra credit. The maze has rotating doors which are just enough to give the game a slightly different feel than the Pac-Man series.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]A proper Lady Bug arcade machine will be in a dedicated cabinet (specifically one of the ultra-curvy early Universal ones, "Mr. Do!", and many others used this same cabinet). Most games from Universal had no specific side art, just a painted 'Universal' logo, and a couple of colored stripes. This makes it possible to actually convert one Universal title into another one, without any loss in value. The joystick is mounted in the center of the control panel. Finally, this game uses a standard resolution monitor mounted vertically.[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) Texas Instruments SN76496 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Lady Bug was released in October 1981.[CR]This game contains unused graphics for a large dinosaur.[CR]Alessandro Laini holds the official record for this game with 4,102,830 points.[CR]A bootleg was made in 1983 by TAI DLI on the "Galaxian" hardware.[CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Cocinella".[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Eating a flower : 10 points x score multiplier value.[CR]Collecting a heart : 100 points x score multiplier value.[CR]Collecting a yellow letter : 300 points x score multiplier value.[CR]Collecting a red letter : 800 points x score multiplier value.[CR]Bonus vegetable : 1,000 points for the cucumber on level one, increasing by 500 points per level, up to a maximum value of 9,500 for the horseradish on level 18 onwards.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Avoid running into skulls at all costs. They represent poison and are deadly to both you and the enemy insects. Not only that, but if you die by touching a skull yourself, all other skulls in the maze are replaced by flowers. If an enemy insect is poisoned by a skull, the skull disappears and the poisoned enemy insect is returned to its base in the center of the maze.[CR]* Use the swing doors to block off the enemy insects' pursuit. Quickly flip a door as you pass it when an enemy insect is behind you and as long as the enemy insect is not too close, its route will be blocked and it will then have to find an alternative route to you. If the enemy insect is too close it will go through the door behind you and there may be no escape.[CR]* Try to collect bonus vegetables when there are still skulls available on the maze. If, after you collect a bonus vegetable, an enemy bug is poisoned by a skull and returned to its base, when it leaves the base another vegetable will appear. This is the key to high scores on later levels when the vegetables are worth anything up to 9,500 points each.[CR]* Get the score multiplier up to x5 as soon as possible. All points on the maze except bonus vegetables will then be multiplied by 5. You should get the hearts before getting ANY letters. The exception is when one of the letters is only 2 spaces above the enemy insects' base, and waiting for it to turn red may prove fatal. Alternatively you can try to collect a letter in this position when the enemy insects are frozen, when you have a few seconds to wait around for it to change.[CR]* Collect all unneeded letters when they are red with the multiplier on x5 for 4,000 points each. For example if you already have the "X" for EXTRA collect it again when it is on red x5.[CR]* Clear the flowers around the enemy insects' base at the start of each level from stage 5 onwards. This is especially important past stage 10 when the enemy insects' speed is much increased. You do not move any faster, and will need to have a good knowledge of the maze layout to avoid them.[CR]* Use the swing doors to force the enemy insects to go where you want them to. Example: stay to the upper right of the enemy insects' base, and let them come to you. When they are close, move the door so they have to pass your position, and when they are past you move the door again, so that they have to go the long way round to get to you again. Wait until all four enemy insects are out and then you can get the bonus vegetable when the way is clear. Watch out though, as some breeds of enemy bugs are particularly stupid (or smart) and will not follow the route you want, but will lurk near you to try and trap you.[CR]* Try to group all four enemy insects close together to increase your chances of getting the bonus vegetable.[CR]* If you quickly flip the same revolving door several times in succession you will notice you move part way through it. You can now walk through this door without spinning it. Useful if you want to wait somewhere and make a getaway without moving the door.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR][US] Atari 2600: release cancelled[CR][US] Colecovision (1982) "Lady Bug [Model 2433]" [CR][US] Mattel Intellivision (1983) "Lady Bug [Model 2483]" [CR]* Computers : [CR][US] Tandy Color Computer (1982) "Doodle Bug"[CR][EU] BBC B (1983) "Bumble-Bee"[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Millipede</title_clean>
				<plot>Millipede (c) 1982 Atari.[CR]Millipede is a 1- or 2-player game with a color raster-scan video display. The game action takes place on a playfield filled with mushrooms, flowers, and deadly DDT bombs. The player tries to destroy a variety of insects that drop from the top of the screen or enter from the sides of the screen, most of them to attack the player. The player controls a bow-shaped vehicle called the Archer. The object of the game is to shoot and destroy as many objects as possible for a high point score, before the player's lives are all used up.[CR]Player control consists of a Midi Trak-Ball control and a FIRE button. The Archer is moved by rotating the Midi Trak-Ball control. The Archer can be moved in all directions, but only within the bottom fifth of the screen. However, the Archer must move around mushrooms, flowers, and DDT bombs, since these are fixed and not 'transparent' objects. Pressing the FIRE button causes the Archer to emit an arrow that travels upward. The Archer may fire one or many arrows (by holding down the FIRE button constantly). But only one arrow will appear on the screen at a time.[CR]A player may start a game at an advanced level of play and receive bonus points for starting play at that level.[CR]Game play begins with a playfield of randomly placed mushrooms and DDT bombs. A Millipede enters at the top center of the screen and starts snaking its way across the screen. The Millipede changes direction when it runs into a fixed object in the playfield (mushroom, DDT bomb, or flower), or when it reaches the side boundaries of the playfield.[CR]When a segment of the Millipede is shot, it is destroyed and a mushroom appears where that segment was shot. When shot, the Millipede breaks into two smaller Millipedes, each with its own head. When a Millipede reaches the bottom of the screen, it starts back up, but remains within the area of the Archer (the bottom 5th of the screen).[CR]If a Millipede reaches the bottom of the screen without being shot, it releases its tail. This tail changes into a new head. Also to provide the player a challenge, if a Millipede is still alive when it reaches the bottom, new heads will enter the screen almost at the bottom of the sides. More of these heads will appear as time progresses.[CR]An attack wave is complete when all Millipede segments are destroyed. The screen then scrolls down one line. At the 9th attack wave, when the Millipede with only four segments enters from the top of the screen, the screen will scroll down every two seconds. The only way a player can stop the scrolling screen is to shoot a DDT bomb or destroy the entire Millipede. [CR]It takes four shots to destroy a mushroom. After the fourth attack wave of each wave cycle, the entire playfield of mushrooms changes. Some mushrooms die and new mushrooms grow where there were none before. A mushroom next to a DDT bomb becomes poisoned (See Tips and Tricks below for complete details).[CR]When a Millipede runs into a poisoned mushroom, two things happen: its head changes color, and it changes direction and falls vertically to the bottom of the screen.[CR]DDT bombs explode when hit by an arrow. Any object near the bomb is engulfed by the explosion. Insects are worth three times their normal point value if they are destroyed by the explosion.[CR]Spiders appear in any round. They move in a random pattern on the bottom third of the screen. As the player's score increases, the range of the Spider decreases, until it is confined to the bottom fifth of the screen. Also, more Spiders enter as the game progresses. A Spider destroys any mushroom or flower it moves over. Depending on a special option switch setting, the Spider moves slowly until a player reaches a specific score, and then it speeds up. If the Archer and a Spider collide, both are destroyed.[CR]When a Millipede with fewer than eleven segments appears, an Earwig enters the screen from either side, moving at a relatively slow speed. As the player earns more points, the Earwig's speed increases. If an Earwig passes over a mushroom, it poisons the mushroom.[CR]When a Millipede with fewer than ten segments appears, a Dragonfly enters at the top of the screen. The Dragonfly moves in a zig-zag pattern and its speed increases as the player's score increases. As the Dragonfly moves, it leaves a trail of mushrooms behind.[CR]When a Millipede with fewer than nine segments appears, a Mosquito enters at the top of the screen and flies in a diagonal pattern. The Mosquito's speed increases as the player's score increases. When a Mosquito is destroyed, the screen scrolls up one row.[CR]Beetles appear randomly after the first wave. They enter from the sides of the screen near the bottom, travel down to the bottom of the screen, and walk at least half way across the bottom. Then the Beetle travels up and exits at the side of the screen. If a Beetle passes over a mushroom, the mushroom changes into a flower. Flowers cannot be destroyed by the Archer's arrows. Depending on a dip switch setting, the number of Beetles appearing on the screen and the speed of the beetles increase as the player's score increases. When a Beetle is destroyed, the screen scrolls down one row.[CR]Bees may fall from the top of the screen during any round. As the Bee falls, it leaves a trail of mushrooms behind. The Archer must hit a Bee twice to destroy it; the first shot just speeds it up.[CR]An Inchworm may appear when a Millipede with fewer that eleven segments appears. The Inchworm travels from one side of the screen to the other side. It moves slowly until the player's score reaches 80,000 points. Then it speeds up. If the Archer destroys the Inchworm, all insects will slow down for about three and one-half seconds.[CR]After a Millipede of one, three, five, seven, or eleven segments has been destroyed, an insect bombing raid occurs. A raid may have only Bees, Dragonflies, Mosquitoes, or a mixture of all three.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Millipede came in two different form factors - an upright and a cocktail table, and it was also available as a conversion kit for "Kangaroo", "Dig Dug", and "Arabian". [CR]* The control panel features a trackball to move the Archer around the player area and a FIRE button for firing the arrows. [CR]* Millipede's trackball is larger in diameter than that of "Centipede", but smaller than that of the upright and cockpit versions of "Missile Command". All of the trackballs are prone to wear and tear, but replacement parts are readily available. [CR]* The upright version, by far the most common, is in a white cabinet that is rather strangely shaped. It really accents the speaker area in a way that no other games did. The game features ornate painted sideart of a huge orange millipede along with a hunter inside a forest scene. That graphic isn't just on the sides either, it continues all the way around the front of the machine as well. The control panel is dark and rather plain. It has the trackball, the FIRE button, some game instructions, and a few graphics of leaves. The marquee for this title shows a hunter clad in red, firing a long bow at an orange millipede. [CR]* The cocktail version is black and woodgrained, and mildly decorated with light blue graphics under the glass and on the control panels. This version has two control panels, on opposite sides of the cabinet; in a two-player game, the players sit across from each other and the screen's image flips over to face whichever player is currently controlling the Archer.

Also, 1,300 cocktails models were build.[CR]Sequels to arcade games can be a 'hit and miss' thing. Taito was able to make a successful sequel to its "Space Invaders" game by releasing "Space Invaders Part II". Atari also attempted to make a sequel to its hit "Asteroids" called "Asteroids Deluxe". Unfortunately, the sequel was not received well and Atari took a loss with it. Atari had another runaway hit in 1980 called "Centipede". The game basically involved having the player take out insects and mushrooms that dotted the playing screen. Taking another chance, Atari released a sequel in 1982 called Millipede. Fortunately, Millipede received a better reception then "Asteroids Deluxe" did as a sequel and it did fairly well at the arcades. Other games that Atari released such as "Dig Dug", "Gravitar", and "Pole Position" may have also helped the sequel along. The game play was essentially the same as the original.[CR]If you go into test mode, you will see a hidden 'Logg' sprite which refers to the game programmer Ed Logg.[CR]Originally called 'Centipede Deluxe'. Here are the main differences between Millipede and "Centipede" : [CR]* Instead of the Centipede and three enemies, you now have to deal with the Millipede and seven enemies. [CR]* In addition to the Bee dropping mushrooms, the Dragonfly also drops them. The difference between the two enemies is that the Bee goes in a straight line from top to bottom while the Dragonfly zig-zags across the screen from top to bottom. [CR]* Beetles turn mushrooms into flowers which can only be destroyed with DDT bombs or by Spiders. [CR]* On some screens, some of the mushrooms will disappear while others grow in other random places. [CR]* The player character is now an Archer, as it now shoots arrows instead of laser-type shots. [CR]* The screen advances down one level after each round is completed or for each Beetle that is hit. This will reveal other things when a new top level is revealed. Hitting a Mosquito causes the screen to advance up by one level. [CR]* Different events are based on how many segments the Millipede starts with (a segment is defined as not being a separate head). [CR]* DDT bombs have been added to help you take out areas of bugs, flowers, and mushrooms. (DDT was a chemical that was banned in the 60's for pest control.) [CR]* A new bonus setting has been implemented. It works depending on what the machine is set at for gaining bonus Archers. Once you cross that threshold multiple, you can start a new game from that score minus the original bonus score. The score tops out at 300,000 points. You have 30 seconds after your game ends to choose to do this. It works like this : [CR]1) The maximum level a player can start at is one level lower then the last free Archer they received.  For example, you receive a free Archer every 20,000 points. If you achieved a score of 50,000 points, then the last free Archer you received was at 40,000 points. Going one level lower, you can either start with a bonus of 0 or 20,000 points. It works the same for free Archers awarded at 12,000 or 15,000 points. [CR]2) The player will also be allowed to start a new game at a bonus level. Again, depending on what the machine settings are for free Archers will determine this bonus. The bonus will be 0, 1, 2, or 3 times whatever the score required is for a free Archer (i.e. 0, 12,000, 24,000, or 36,000 points to name one). You will have 10 seconds to make a decision.[CR]* There are more score dependent settings for the game. This means more enemies will do different things depending on the player's score.[CR]* Millipede cycles back and forth with head to body ratio instead of just having heads like Centipede does.[CR]James Schneider holds the official record for this game with 6,995,962 points.[CR]A Millipede unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1988 movie 'Arthur 2 - On the Rocks'.[CR]In 1982, Atari released a set of 12 collector pins including : "Missile Command", "Battlezone", "Tempest", "Asteroids Deluxe", "Space Duel", "Centipede", "Gravitar", "Dig Dug", "Kangaroo", "Xevious", "Millipede" and "Food Fight".[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Millipede (body segment) : 10 points[CR]Millipede (head segment) : 100 points[CR]Spider : 300, 600, 900, 1,200 points (Points increase the closer the Spider is to the player's Archer when shot)[CR]Earwig : 1,000 points[CR]DDT Bomb : 800 points[CR]Dragonfly : 500 points[CR]Mosquito : 400 points[CR]Beetle : 300 points[CR]Bee : 200 points (Takes 2 hits. First hit speeds it up, second hit destroys it)[CR]Inchworm : 100 points[CR]Mushrooms &amp; Poisoned Mushrooms : 1 point (Takes 4 hits to destroy).[CR]When the mushroom patch is reset after the Archer is destroyed, each partially destroyed mushroom, poisoned mushroom or flower that is restored awards the player 5 bonus points. [CR]Enemies killed inside DDT blasts are worth three times their normal score. The exception to this are Spiders which are worth 1,800 points when killed by DDT and enemies on the raids which are worth their normal (progressive) point values.[CR]Raids : Normal points for the first raiding insect killed. Additional kills on raiding insects are worth 100 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 1,000 points each.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hints :[CR]1) Destroy mushrooms near the bottom of the screen.[CR]2) Destroy the DDT bomb when the Millipede is beside it.[CR]3) When a Millipede hits a poisoned mushroom, it changes direction and falls vertically. Anticipate the place the Millipede will fall, because shooting it as it falls destroys all its segments.[CR]* Know Your Enemies : This is the single most important aspect of this game. If you don't know how each of the enemies behave, you won't last long. The enemies are :[CR]1) Millipede (Body and Head) - The main target of the game; its role is basically identical to that of the Centipede in "Centipede". It goes back and forth across the screen and will drop to the next level when it encounters a mushroom, flower, DDT bomb, or the side of the game screen. It will go all the way to the bottom when its head hits a poisoned mushroom. [CR]2) Spider - It appears from the top left or right of the player area. Its role is basically the same as in "Centipede". It will either bounce across the player's area at 45 degree angles or bounce in at a 45 degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, go to the middle at a 45 degree angle, bounce up and down a couple of times, then finally go to the side opposite its entrance (at a 45 degree angle), bounce up and down, then exit the area. It destroys flowers and mushrooms it passes over. In later stages, multiple Spiders will appear.[CR]3) Bee - It can appear in any attack wave. Its role is identical to that of the Flea in "Centipede". It falls from the top of the screen to the bottom, randomly depositing mushrooms along the way. A Bee takes two shots to kill. The first shot makes it angry and causes it to speed up its descent. It will usually appear when you have cleared out most of the mushrooms in the player area.[CR]4) Beetle - It appear randomly after the first wave. It enters from the left or right side of the screen, then goes to the bottom. It travels at least halfway along the bottom before going up to its original entry level. It then exits from the side opposite from which it entered. All mushrooms in its path are converted to flowers which are immune to the Archer's arrows. Hitting a Beetle causes the screen to go down one level. [CR]5) Earwig - It appears when the Millipede begins with less then eleven body segments. Its role is identical to that of the Scorpion in "Centipede". It goes across the screen and poisons any mushrooms in its path. [CR]6) Inchworm - It first appears when the Millipede has less then eleven body segments. Hitting one causes all enemies on the screen to slow down for about three seconds. [CR]7) Dragonfly - It appears when the Millipede begins with less then ten body segments. It goes in a zig-zag pattern from top to bottom leaving a trail of mushrooms in its wake. [CR]8) Mosquito - It appears when the Millipede begins with less then nine body segments. It flies in a diagonal pattern from the upper left or upper right corners. Hitting one causes the screen to go up one level.[CR]* The Millipede will start out as a head with eleven body segments in the first wave. Wave two will be a head with ten body segments and a head that enters from the opposite side. Wave three will be a head with nine body segments and two heads that enter from opposite sides. This progression keeps going until wave twelve where you have twelve heads. The cycle will then start over in wave thirteen. This cycle occurs every twelve distinct waves.[CR]* You must clear the first Millipede wave only once. Then, until your score reaches 20000 points, you must complete each subsequent Millipede wave twice--first as the Millipede moves slowly towards you, then as it moves fast. After your score reaches 20,000 points, each Millipede wave will only need to be completed once.[CR]* Shooting the Millipede can have two effects : [CR]1) If you shoot the head, then that part turns into a mushroom and the next segment becomes the new head and the Millipede will travel in the opposite direction (since it hit the newly-created mushroom).[CR]2) If you shoot the middle of the body, then the segment hit will become a mushroom. The existing Millipede will continue in the same direction. The new Millipede will develop a head at the next segment after the break and head off in the opposite direction. [CR]* A good strategy to ensure you destroy the Millipedes in one stroke and to keep the Bees at bay is to create 'mushroom corridors'. Mushroom corridors are basically corridors between two rows of mushrooms where you can funnel the Millipede down and destroy it when it is moving head-first at your shooter.[CR]* In reference to the above 'mushroom corridors', keep in mind that after the fourth wave of each cycle, the mushrooms will undergo a period of 'Growth' that determines whether they stay alive or die in accordance with a modified version of the 'life' algorithm. The rules are as follows: [CR]1) Any mushroom with fewer than two neighbours dies, as if by loneliness. [CR]2) Any mushroom with more than three neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding. [CR]3) Any mushroom with two or three neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation. [CR]4) Any empty space with exactly three mushroom neighbours comes to life. [CR]5) Any mushroom adjacent to a DDT bomb becomes poisoned [CR]6) Any non-poisoned mushroom adjacent to a poisoned mushroom dies [CR]7) Flowers cannot die, but do count as neighbours towards the growth of mushrooms. [CR]After this period of 'Growth', you may have to clean up the area since some of your corridors may have been affected by this change. [CR]* Watch out for the Spiders. They enter at either the top or bottom corners. Your Archer may be in the way if this happens. In addition to collisions, the Spiders wipe out all mushrooms that are in its path. This can create problems when you are creating mushroom corridors. It can also cause Bees to appear since you won't have many mushrooms in the player area. In later rounds, multiple Spiders may appear in the player area.[CR]* At the beginning of a round, take a quick look to see how many segments the Millipede has. This will determine the behavior of enemies on that or subsequent rounds.[CR]* Five different times during the cycle of twelve millipede attack waves, you will be bombarded by a swarm of insects. These waves are a major source of points.[CR]After the 2nd wave : Bee raid [CR]After the 6th wave : Dragonfly raid [CR]After the 8th wave : Mosquito raid [CR]After the 10th wave : Bees and Dragonflies raid together [CR]After the 12th wave : Bees, dragonflies, and mosquitoes raid together [CR]During these raids, special scoring applies for shooting Bees, Dragonflies, and Mosquitoes. Each insect kill of those types (even types not actually swarming, for example a single Bee randomly dropping during the Mosquito swarm) is worth a minimum of 100 points more than the previous kill, to a maximum of 1,000 points. Triple scoring from DDT applies as well, so DDTing a Mosquito or Dragonfly will immediately max the raid value at 1000, and DDTing a Bee will register at least 600.[CR]It's very important not to die during one of the raids. If you stay alive, a raid can be worth up to 30,000 points later in the game. To prepare for a raid, don't shoot the last head until any Spiders and Beetles are near the side and leaving the screen. Clear a path to a DDT bomb if possible, so you can use it to kill several insects at once. It will quickly build their value to the maximum of 1000 points each.[CR]Concentrate on one thing - shooting as many bugs as you can. Don't waste time clearing mushrooms until after the raid is over. As your score increases, the length of the raids also increases, making them worth lots of points.[CR]* On the 9th wave, the mushrooms begin scrolling down very quickly, roughly one row every two seconds. They don't stop unless you kill the Millipede, shoot a DDT bomb, or lose a life. You have to do one of these three things quickly, or you'll be overwhelmed by mushrooms on the bottom.[CR]First try to hit a DDT bomb. It's a good idea to clear a path to one before the wave starts. If you can't use a DDT, try to kill the Millipede before the mushrooms get too low. As a last resort, die on purpose.[CR]The scrolling wave follows the Mosquito raid. If you can shoot a lot of Mosquitoes in the raid, the mushrooms scroll way up the screen, and you'll have plenty of time to kill the Millipede while the mushrooms come back down. Remember, if you scroll the mushrooms way up the screen, you won't be able to fire very fast. You'll have to take single shots, making sure you hit the Millipede each time.[CR]* You can have a maximum of 4 DDT bombs on the screen at any given time. Wait until either the Millipede is right next to one or there is a heavy concentration of enemies before setting it off.[CR]* Beetles can cause a lot of problems if they aren't dealt with quickly. Of course, if you have your mushroom corridor set up, they may be a blessing. Since they create flowers in their path that are immune to your Archer's arrows, this would help prevent you from shooting them accidentally. Of course, you still have to worry about the Spiders and DDT bombs.[CR]* Keep track of where the Earwigs move across the screen. As soon as a Millipede's head hits a poisoned mushroom, it will immediately head for the bottom of the screen. The only way to stop this headlong plunge is to shoot it in the head (Unlike in "Centipede", the Millipede's head turns a different color when it is heading directly for the bottom of the screen). In the later rounds, it is not uncommon to have multiple Earwigs going across the screen. They also provide the most points in the game. [CR]* If you get unlucky and let the Millipede into your area, you need to destroy it before it gets to the bottom of the player area. Once it reaches the bottom, it will ascend again and remain in the player area. If it does reach the bottom of the player area, another head will come out from the opposite side to start its back and forth march across the screen. This will continue until you destroy all the Millipede parts in the player area or until your Archer is destroyed. [CR]* If your Archer gets destroyed, all partially-destroyed mushrooms and all poisoned mushrooms are reset. Flowers created by Beetles are also changed back into mushrooms. You then start at the beginning of the wave you got killed on.[CR]* Depending on the difficulty the machine is set up at, the following events occur :[CR]1) At Easy, the Spider moves slowly up to 10,000 points. At Hard, the Spider moves slowly up to 5,000 points. [CR]2) At Easy, the Beetle moves slowly up to 400,000 points and four Beetles appear in each round after 500,000 points. At Hard, the Beetle moves slowly up to 300,000 points and four Beetles appear in each round after 350,000 points. [CR]3) At Easy, Millipede heads enter from the sides of the screen at timed intervals. At Hard, Millipede heads enter from the sides of the screen faster than at Easy.[CR]4) Regardless of setting, the Inchworm will move faster after the player reaches 80,000 points.[CR]5) All other enemies move at their same speeds.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Moon Cresta (c) 1980 Nichibutsu.[CR]MOON CRESTA is a 1 or 2-player game in which players may compete for highest score against the game computer. Each time a player is hit by an alien, the game switches to his opponent's sequence.[CR]The object is to destroy as many of the descending aliens as possible. To accomplish this the player is given a three stage multi-fire Warship. He begins with the first stage, firing a single laser at the enemy. If he is successful in eliminating the first 4 sets of aliens, he is given an opportunity to dock his first stage onto the second within a specific time limit (the sooner he unites the stages, the higher is his awarded score).[CR]Once docked, the stages combine their firing power, so the first (1 laser) adds to the second (2 lasers) giving the player a total of 3 usable lasers as the game continues.[CR]The player then must face 2 more sets of aliens and a shower of meteors, after which he has a chance to dock again, this time uniting with the third stage for a combined fire power of five lasers. If he is able to defeat the last two sets of aliens intact, the entire sequence begins again. The game continues with increasing difficulty until the entire warship is destroyed. When the warship is hit the player continues with whatever stages remain. If his score reaches 30,000 he is awarded a free game and his score continues to accumulate.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Model MCA-5001 (Upright)[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Tone generator &amp; discrete circuits[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-way joystick (RIGHT and LEFT)[CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE/THRUST)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Moon Cresta was released in July 1980.[CR]Marcus McHaffie holds the official record for this game with 153,490 points.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is relatively simple. Each alien (except meteors and arrows) come in two different colors for each screen.[CR]Eyes (Break in half) : 50 points[CR]Eyes (Destroy other half) : 100 points[CR]Flies : 30 points[CR]Birds : 60 points[CR]Fireballs : 200 points[CR]Arrow Ships : 100 points[CR]Docking is a big way to increase your score. You get the time remaining from 30 seconds multiplied by 100 for your docking bonus.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, all three stages of your ship will come from the bottom of the screen. After going halfway up, the ship on top separates from the other 2 and it settles onto the bottom of the screen ready for battle.[CR]* Remember, you can only keep one set of shots in the 'air' at one time. This means you need to plan your shots out so you don't end up with a lot of misses when the aliens decided to come after your ship.[CR]* In the later screens, the aliens start moving much quicker and you have to be on your toes to keep up with them and avoid being taken out.[CR]* Although the aliens do not fire, they still can cause a lot of hate and discontent by their wild maneuvering. There is no real safe place on the screen from the aliens since they go into the lower corners of the screen, reappear from the bottom after they have apparently 'left' the screen, or just appear right above your ship.[CR]* In the earlier waves, you have to split apart 2 eyes before the rest automatically split and come after your ship. In the later screens, the eyes automatically split upon entering the screen. That means eight instead of four aliens you have to deal with.[CR]* If you manage to dock all three ships together, you will have a lot of firepower (5 shots at once) to send out. Here are some ways, unfortunately, you can lose ships and what ships are lost :[CR]1) Besides the aliens, docking is the second way people lose a lot of ships. The only ship destroyed is the ship attempting to dock.[CR]2) If an alien hits any part of your ships (if all stages are joined), only the stage hit is lost. This can create an amusing circumstance if you lose stage II and you only have stages I and III to fight with.[CR]* Don't worry if you lose Stage I early in the game. One has to be very skilled to fight four screens with Stage I. Stage II is the best stage to fight with. It is a small target plus it has enough firepower to defend itself. Stage III on the other hand, is just a lumbering junkyard. The lasers are too spread out to do much good plus there is a very wide-open area in the middle for aliens to hit.[CR]* The bird stages present the most challenge of the aliens. They appear and disappear at will. Sometimes they will appear right next to your ship so on these stages, be extra alert. If you see one disappear and don't hear the familiar bird chirp of it reappearing, assume it is on the screen somewhere still.[CR]* The best place to 'hide' during the fireball stage is in the lower right corner. The fireballs will not hit your ship in this corner. You can do hit and runs by moving your ship out, shooting at a fireball, then going back to the corner again.[CR]* During the arrow screen, the aliens will hover around the top, then turn into arrows and attempt to ram your ship. In the later screens, they won't even hover but just try to ram your ship.[CR]* Your goal is to make it to 30,000 points so you can have a fresh ship waiting in case you lose all the stages of your present ship.[CR]* Docking isn't that hard to do. After finishing off a wave just before the docking stage, try to center your ship on the screen. That way, all you have to do is move that ship left or right to successfully dock. You want to avoid using the thrusters unless your ship is in extreme peril. The docking bonus can be the most amount of points you score in the game. If you happen to miss a dock, then you will continue the next set of screens with the ship that failed to dock.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Moon Cresta (1980)[CR]2. Terra Cresta (1985)[CR]3.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Mr. Do!</title_clean>
				<plot>Mr. Do! (c) 1983 Universal.[CR]Mr. Do! is a colourful and addictive maze game in which the player takes on the role of the eponymous Mr. Do, a circus clown, who must clear each level of either cherries or monsters. The game's single screen levels are made up of tunnels surrounded by a colourful, soil-like substance. This soil can be dug through to create new tunnels, allowing Mr. Do to escape his enemies and to reach the many cherries that litter the levels. A number of apples are also scattered around each level, and Mr. Do can push them along tunnels (to block and/or kill monsters) or can tunnel beneath them to drop them onto the heads of any pursuing enemies. Mr. Do himself can also be killed by a falling apple.[CR]Mr. Do is armed with a 'Powerball' that can be fired down a tunnel, it will then bounce around the tunnels until it either returns to Mr. Do, or comes into contact with, and kills, one of the level's monsters. The Powerball regenerates immediately the first time you use it, but takes longer each time it is used to return to your hands. As each level progresses, the monsters themselves start to dig tunnels of their own in their pursuit of Mr. Do. Monsters can also push the apples.[CR]Each screen has a doorway through which the monsters enter the level. Once all of the monsters have appeared, the doorway will turn into a 'prize', (ice cream, biscuits, etc.). If Mr. Do collects the prize, the 'Alphamonster' and his three 'Muncher' henchmen will appear. The Alphamonster may be in the EXTRA box at the top of the screen or be moving around the screen. The Alphamonster and the Munchers cannot be easily crushed under apples because they tend to eat them. They can be killed individually with the Powerball or by killing the Alphamonster itself, at which point any remaining Munchers will turn into apples.[CR]After every three levels, there is a brief intermission in which a tune is played and a large, animated Mr. Do appears, together with some of the game's monsters. The time to complete each level and the preferred method (monsters, cherries, Alphamonsters, or Diamond) is shown. The paths in the first level resemble a 'D', after this each level's tunnels resemble a digit, ('2', '3', '4' etc.) up to '0' for level 10.[CR]A level can be completed any one of several different ways : either by collecting all of the on-screen cherries; by killing all of the monsters, by completing the EXTRA box, or by collecting the diamond. The latter appears only very occasionally ('Special' awards an extra credit).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Prom Stickers : D1-D10[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) Texas Instruments SN76496[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Mr. Do! was released in December 1982. It was also licensed to Taito.[CR]Mr. Do! was inspired by "Dig Dug" and was the first in a series of four Mr. Do! games. Mr. Do! was one of video-gaming's biggest arcade successes. Unfortunately for Universal, none of their other games could match it in commercial terms. [CR]It is the game responsible for launching the kit game craze in the U.S. video game industry.[CR]David Breckon holds the official record for this game with 26,030,050 points.[CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Mr. Lo!", and another is called "Mr. Du!".[CR]There are several well-known hacks of Mr Do! which are as follows :[CR]* Mr. DigDo! - graphics changed to make them look more like those of Namco's "Dig Dug".[CR]* Mr. Jong - Changes the clown into an old Chinese man, the monsters into clowns and the apples into mahjong blocks.[CR]* Yankee Do! - Changes the graphics to make them more American patriotic.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]On the Prototype version (which is a Japanese hack) :[CR]* You are a 'Yukidaruma' (a snowman) with green arms instead of the famous clown.[CR]* You dig with a rake in your hands.[CR]* There is a mean expression when you push an apple.[CR]* The screen does not turn red when you grab cookies, cake, etc...[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Eating a cherry : 50 points.[CR]Eating a series of 8 cherries in a row : 500 points bonus.[CR]Killing a monster with your snowball : 500 points.[CR]Killing one monster with one apple : 1,000 points.[CR]Killing two monsters with one apple : 2,000 points.[CR]Killing three monsters with one apple : 4,000 points.[CR]Killing four monsters with one apple : 6,000 points.[CR]Killing five or more monsters with one apple : 8,000 points.[CR]Collecting special (free credit) diamond : 8,000 points.[CR]Collecting bonus treat from empty monster home: 1,000 points on level one, increasing incremently up to a maximum of 8,000 points on level 22 onwards.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* 255 Lives Tricks : It's possible to win 255 lives on the first screen, but only if an apple appears in the top two rows of the playfield.[CR]1) Begin by digging a tunnel directly from the bottom of the screen to just below the apple, but leave enough dirt under it that it doesn't fall.[CR]2) Next, kill all of the enemies but one, then lose all of your extra lives. As soon as you're on your last life, go right under the apple and wait.[CR]3) Eventually, the remaining enemy will come after you. Allow the apple to drop, but, in the interval before you're squashed, kill the enemy with the powerball. If all has gone well, you'll be carried to the bottom of the screen, the music will go haywire for a moment, and you'll be awarded 255 extra lives.[CR]4) Note that you should always lose a life before spelling 'EXTRA', or you'll roll back to zero lives, so, to be safe, immediately kill yourself at the start of level two.[CR]5) IMPORTANT : This trick will only work with the Taito version of Mr. Do!.[CR]* Here's A Neat Trick : You can divide the screen into a grid. The cherries, apples, and tunnel corners are all centered on a grid element. If you are being chased by the normal badguys (not ghosts) you can dig and stop between grid elements. The badguy will think it needs to turn into a digger to get you. While he's changing forms, you can escape.[CR]* An Alphamonster will appear every time your score reaches a multiple of 5,000.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Mr. Do! (1982)[CR]2.

				<plot>Ms. Pac-Man (c) 1981 Midway. [CR]In this, the first proper sequel to Namco's legendary pill eating maze game, players must once again run around a number of mazes, eating all of the pills that are scattered throughout. The ever-present ghosts (Blinky, Pinky, Inky and Sue) return to hamper the player's progress. The infamous 'Power Pills' are also present and correct, with four appearing in each maze. [CR]Namco introduced a number of changes and enhancements over the original game. The first difference is in the main character. For the first time in video-game history, the game's lead character was female. Ms. Pac-Man is almost identical to the original character with two main differences; she wears a bow in her 'hair', and is also wearing lipstick. [CR]Another change from the original is that the bonus fruit items are no longer static but now move randomly around the mazes. [CR]Ms Pac-Man features four different maze layouts, which alternate every two to four rounds : [CR]The first maze is only encountered in Rounds 1 and 2, and has 220 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze equidistant from the center of the maze. You must clear this maze two times before moving on to the next maze. [CR]The second maze is only encountered in Rounds 3, 4, and 5, and has 240 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze; one set in the lower half, and the other set at the very top. You must clear this maze three times before moving on to the next maze. [CR]The third maze is first encountered in Round 6 and has 238 dots and 4 Power Pills. Unlike all other mazes, there is only one set of tunnels in this maze, slightly above the center of the board. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. [CR]The fourth and final unique maze is first encountered in Round 10 and has 234 dots and 4 Power Pills. There are two sets of tunnels in this maze, directly next to one another in the middle of the maze. The turns at the entrance to the tunnels change the usual immediate accessibility of the tunnels and should be taken in to account. You must clear this maze four times before moving on to the next maze. [CR]After Round 13, the game alternates every four rounds between the third and fourth mazes. [CR]Finally, the ghosts' movement patterns are also completely different from those of the original game. [CR]As in the original game, intermission scenes will be played after certain rounds. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions tell the story of how Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man met, fell in love, and had a baby. Ms. Pac-Man's intermissions are also preceded by a sign and a title. 3 intermissions are present : [CR]1) Act I - They Meet : Pac-Man, the star of the original game, enters the screen being chased by Inky while Ms. Pac-Man enters from the other side being chased by Pinky. As the two of them are about to collide, they quickly move upwards, causing Inky and Pinky to collide. Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man face each other at the top of the screen, and a heart appears above them. This intermission is played after Round 2. [CR]2) Act II - The Chase : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man are seen giving each other a playful chase. One chases the other in one direction, and they take turns alternating who chases who and in what direction. After three turns, they chase each other twice more at a faster speed. This intermission is played after Round 5. [CR]3) Act III - Junior : Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man anxiously await the arrival of a stork, who flies overhead with a bundle. As the stork is about to pass over them, he releases the bundle, which drops to the ground in front of Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, and opens up to reveal a baby Pac. This intermission, which is played after Rounds 9, 13, and 17, would later serve as the introductory sequence to "Jr. Pac-Man". [CR]No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model] [CR][No. 595] [CR]The upright model came in the standard Namco/Midway cabinet. This is the same 'swoopy' cabinet that "Galaxian", "Galaga", and "Pac-Man" came in as well. These featured painted side-art of Ms. Pac-Man and the ghosts, along with some pink accent lines. The last 10, 000 or so Ms. Pac-Man machines to roll off the assembly line had sticker side-art instead, it was the same basic scene, but the colors were brighter, and there were a few minor differences in the layout of the graphics. The marquee showed an image of Ms. Pac-Man lounging on her own logo, with a ghost off to the side. The exact colors used on the marquee varied a bit over the production run (as did the paint codes used on the side). The control panel and monitor bezel had a single design that covered both of them, that of a blue background with a pink or maroon stripe going around it, with a few game instructions printed upon them. [CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG (@ 96 Khz)  [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Having won their enhancement kit lawsuit against Atari, General Computing went to Bally Midway and showed them an enhancement kit that they were working on for Pac-Man called Crazy Otto. Crazy Otto was a character similar to Pac-Man with the exception that he had legs. GCC was going to bluff Midway into letting them release their enhancement kit by telling them that they won their lawsuit against Atari, and that they just wanted Midway's blessing. Midway suggested that they create a sequel to the original Pac-Man instead of an enhancement kit, and GCC got to work on Ms. Pac-Man. Ms. Pac-Man had two prior names before settling on the one that everyone knows. 'Mrs. Pac-Man' was the original, but some of the women employees at Midway had a problem with that, so it was changed to 'Miss Pac-Man'. When someone pointed out the third intermission, where Pac and Ms. Pac welcome "Jr. Pac-Man" (or Baby Pac-Man) into the fold, they changed it to the final name of 'Ms. Pac-Man'. Midway released "Baby Pac-Man" as a pinball/video hybrid, and General Computing sued the company, claiming they had created the concept of a Pac Family. They won the suit and were awarded royalties from Pac Family merchandise. [CR]The logo for General Computer Corporation is present among the graphics, probably a leftover from the game's days as Crazy Otto.[CR]In its initial run, 110,000 units were produced in the U.S. making it the best selling domestic arcade video game of all time. [CR]The game added a few improvements over the original : [CR]* Non-deterministic artificial intelligence for the ghosts, making it harder for enthusiasts to follow set patterns through levels. [CR]* A variety of different mazes used through the game. [CR]* Bonus items (such as cherries and pretzels) entered the maze and bounced through it, rather than appear in a set location as in the original, making the player go out of his way to attain it. [CR]* Brand new sound effects, including a new 'death' sound and opening theme. [CR]It was also one of the more successful of early arcade games in the female demographic, which has been attributed to 'Ms. Pac-Man' being a girl - although the Ms. Pac-Man sprite was little more than "Pac-Man" with eyelashes, a bow, lipstick and a dimple. [CR]After the 255th level, the maze (including dots) disappears. The game becomes unplayable, since there are no more dots to eat. [CR]Chris Ayra holds the record for this game on 'Regular' settings with 920,310 points on August 16, 1998. [CR]Victor Kunisada holds the record for this game on 'Speed-Up' settings with 922,810 points on June 16, 2001. [CR]Vancouver, Canada (Reuters) - Little 7-year old Al Nagac attained the Guinness World Record for Ms. Pac-Man v.2.97 with a score of 18,976,048. Al was exhausted and dehydrated and asked for several glasses of skim milk after shattering the longtime record of 11,056,736 set by Faith DeRivera, who was onhand to congratulate the victor with a kiss on the cheek. [CR]A Ms. Pac-Man unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1984 movie 'Tightrope' (the cab appears in the background of the bar scene), in the 1990 movie 'The Grifters', in the 1999 movie 'Man In The Moon' and in the 2002 movie 'Van Wilder'. [CR]Milton Bradley (MB) released a board game based on this video game in 1983. Up to 4 players can play. The maze is divided into four colored areas, representing each player; the object of the game is to clear all the dots in your colored area. Only one player at a time controls Ms. Pac-Man; the other players control the ghosts. Once a ghost catches Ms. Pac-Man, the player controlling that ghost takes over control of Ms. Pac-Man. [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game (Midway upright). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24th, 2009.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Dot : 10 points [CR]Power pill (energizer) : 50 points [CR]Ghosts : 200, 400, 800, 1,600 points [CR]Cherry : 100 points [CR]Strawberry : 200 points [CR]Peach : 500 points [CR]Pretzel : 700 points [CR]Apple : 1,000 points [CR]Pear : 2,000 points [CR]Banana : 5,000 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* The most dangerous section of the first maze is the long path at the very top. It is safest to clear it when the ghosts are blue, or at least 3 of them occupy the bottom half of the maze. [CR]* There are a couple of dangerous sections in the second maze. The pathways above and below the T section at the top of the maze can be particularly easy to get trapped in. It is easiest to clear these when all 4 ghosts are close on your tail, or after eating one of the top two power pellets. The two sections directly above the lower escape tunnels on either side should also be cleared with caution. [CR]* The most dangerous section of the 3rd maze is the center of the bottom, directly below where you begin. It is advisable to clear it out as early as possible before the ghosts can organize and trap you. The top section of the maze presents the ghosts with many pathways to reach you, so use caution. [CR]* The most dangerous sections of the 4th maze is the section that you begin in, and the section directly above the ghosts' den. The very top section of the maze should also be cleared with caution. [CR]* Secret Message : the message 'GENERAL COMPUTER CORPORATION Hello, Nakamura!' is buried at the end of the Ms. Pac-Man ROM image (Masaya Nakamura was head of Namco). [CR]* There's a fairly well-known glitch in the game - if you put a coin in when the Ms. Pac-Man marquee title first appears but before Blinky appears then the first board will be blue instead of pink and will remain blue until you either finish the board or lose a life, after which the board will return to its normal color.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

The early favorite was Tom Asaki, who came close but failed in attempts at Twin Galaxies arcade in Ottumwa IA (once when the joystick broke after he scored 793 million points). Tim McVey finally broke the billion-point barrier with a score of 1,000,042,270 points after six unsuccessful attempts (he passed out after one of them) and January 28 1984 was declared Tim McVey day in Ottumwa.[CR]McVey's record stood until February 22, 2009 when Dwayne Richard exceeded him with a score of 1,004,328,140. On April 10, 2009, McVey attempted to regain his Nibbler WR and recorded his progress through a webcam which was streamed from the Twin Galaxies website and Ustream.tv. However after almost 40 hours of gameplay and 945,939,420 points, McVey was forced to walk away after developing a blister in his hand.

				<plot>Pac-Man (c) 1980 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]Export release by Bally/Midway for North America. Game developed by Namco and originally known as Puckman in Japan. For more information about the game itself, please see the original Japanese release entry, "Puckman [Upright model]".[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Upright model[CR]Game No. 932[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Pac-Man was released in October 1980 in North America by Bally/Midway, under license from Namco. 96,000 units were produced in America. [CR]Reportedly, when Bally/Midway obtained the rights to Pac-Man, Namco was offering four different games, which ended up being licensed to Game Plan and Bally/Midway. Game Plan's Ken Anderson reports that he and Bally's Dave Marofske flipped a coin to see who would get first crack at the games. Game Plan won and chose a tank game (which they released as "Tank Battalion") over Pac-Man. The other game they got was released as "King &amp; Balloon". Bally/Midway, meanwhile, took Pac-Man and "Rally-X".[CR]Midway made the following changes to the game (from the original Namco version):[CR]- The game's name (and likewise its main character) has been changed to Pac-Man. Refer to the Namco Upright version entry, Trivia section, for details behind this name change. [CR]- The name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in this version are:[CR]Shadow - "Blinky" (red ghost)[CR]Speedy - "Pinky" (pink ghost)[CR]Bashful - "Inky" (cyan ghost)[CR]Pokey - "Clyde" (orange ghost)[CR]- Notice that the pink ghost's nickname remains unchanged from the Japanese version.[CR]- Unlike the Japanese version, the American version has no DIP switch for alternate ghost names.  [CR]The game's cult status in the early 80's was such that it inspired a hit song by 'Buckner and Garcia' called 'Pac-Man Fever', released in 1982 on the album of the same name. [CR]The game also spawned a virtual cottage industry of best-selling how-to books strategy guides on how to beat the game by using patterns with names like the "Bazo's Breaker", the "Donut Dazzler" and the "GET pattern" (named after the first initials of the members of a team of players from Davis, California: George Huang, Ed Bazo, and Tom Fertado). [CR]A Pac-Man unit appears in the movie 'Getting There', in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll &amp; Hyde - Together Again', in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High', in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks', in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance', in the 1985 movie 'The Heavenly Kid', in the 1985 movie 'Better Off Dead', and in the 1986 movie 'The Color of Money'. [CR]A Pac-Man unit appears in the pilot of Season One of 'The A-Team'. It is where Amy (Melinda Culea) meets Murdock (Dwight Schultz) for the first time. [CR]MB (Milton Bradley) released a board game based on this video game in 1982 (Pac-Man Game, 'As Much Fun as the Action Packed Arcade Game of the Same Name'). In this board game, the dots in the maze are represented by white marbles. There are also yellow marbles representing the power pills in the maze. There are also two ghosts pawns of the same color in the game. The object is to roll the dice and move your Pac-Man playing piece around the maze gobbling up as many marbles as you can using the count on one die, and move either ghost pawn using the count on the other die. There are yellow dots imprinted on the game board to lay out the path each character must take; these dots do not count as spaces. Use the ghosts to try to catch your opponents. When this happens, that opponent is sent back home and surrenders two marbles to the player who moved the ghost. If a Pac-Man gobbles up a yellow marble, that player earns the right to gobble a ghost. When this happens, the gobbled ghost is returned to the ghost pen, the player takes two marbles away from any opponent, and the player's yellow marble is returned to the game board. Once the maze is cleared of white marbles, the game is over and the player with the most white marbles (yellow marbles do not count) is the winner. [CR]'Pac-Man' is also the nickname of the Filipino boxing champion Manny Pacquiao. The two-time world champion earned the distinction as the only boxer who has knocked down both future Mexican 'Hall of Famer' Marco Antonio 'Baby Face Assassin' Barrera (knocked out in 11th round) and Erik 'El Terrible' Morales (knocked out in 10th round). Pacquiao has been on the top 10 list of the best 'pound-for-pound' fighters in the world. [CR]In the multi-racial country of Malaysia, 'Pac-Man' is a slang term coined to describe men who only date ladies of other races. [CR]The name 'Pac-Man' has been given to a nebula, cataloged as NGC 281. The Pac-Man Nebula is an H II region in the constellation of Cassiopeia. It includes or is near the open cluster IC 1590, the double star HD 5005, and several Bok globules. The shape of the nebula resembles the famous video game icon, Pac-Man. It is visible in amateur telescopes from dark sky locations. [CR]The Cassini Robotic spacecraft (Cassini-Huygens) were captured images during a close pass to the moon of Saturn named 'Mimas', and collected by the composite infrared spectrometer (CIRS). The images show the fluctuating temperatures experienced by Mimas. The combined map with this images form a shape of this character Pac-Man. [CR]On May 21, 2010, to celebrate Pac-Man's 30th Anniversary, Google, the famous internet search engine, has created the first ever interactive Doodle! This doodle allowed people to play Pac-Man on the home page (at the place of the original logo).[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Midway's new revision program for Pac-Man was released in December 1981; the new program increases the difficulty of the game and adds a new challenge to players already familiar with the original.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]NOTE: Only ports released in North America are listed here.

				<plot>Space Panic (c) 1980 Universal Company, Limited.[CR]Influential computer game designer and writer Chris Crawford calls Space Panic "the granddaddy of all platform games", as it predates Nintendo's Donkey Kong (from 1981) which is often cited as the original platform game. Space Panic lacks Donkey Kong's jump mechanic - the main character instead digs holes in the platforms into which he must lure the aliens. He must then hit them to knock them out of the hole and off the screen. In later levels, two or more holes must be lined up vertically in order to dispose of the aliens. There is also a limited supply of oxygen.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.802666 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DAC[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Space Panic was released in November 1980.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Pengo</title_clean>
				<plot>Pengo (c) 1982 Sega.[CR]Pengo the Penguin is the eponymous star of Pengo the video game. The basic layout of Pengo is akin to that of Namco's legendary "Pac-Man"; featuring, as it does, a top down, single screen, maze-like arrangement. Pengo's enemies, the Sno-Bees, are also similar to Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde - the ghosts that pursued Pac-Man; not least because Sno-Bees also come in four different varieties, each represented by a different color.[CR]One aspect that distinguishes Pengo from the Namco classic is that the Maze itself is a wholly interactive environment. Each section of wall is represented as a block of ice, which can be pushed onto the Sno-Bees to destroy them. The Sno-Bees themselves will destroy the ice blocks as they move around each level, so speed is of the essence. Some of the blocks are 'Diamond blocks' which cannot be destroyed, and can be re-used by Pengo.[CR]The outer wall of each level can also be utilized; if the player pushes against the wall when a Sno-Bee is next to it, the Sno-Bee will be temporarily stunned, allowing Pengo to move in for the kill.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID: 834-0386[CR]Main CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 3.02 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips: Namco 3-channel WSG (@ 96 Khz)[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 1 (PUSH)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Pengo was released in September 1982 and developed by Coreland Technology.[CR]Pengo makes a cameo appearance in "Up'n Down". If a player manages to pass the first 4 rounds in under a minute each, he will appear in the water of round 5 riding a surf-board.[CR]Rodney Day holds the official record for this game with 1110370 points.[CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Penta".[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Set 2 &amp; 4 draws its maze much more quickly and has snappy original music, whereas Set 1 &amp; 3's music is a copy of an instrumental pop song (Hot Butter - Popcorn - 1972).[CR]Set 2, 3, 4 correct a Test Menu Bug.[CR]The curtain speed is fastest on Set 2.[CR]The demo mode is different in Set 2.[CR]Set 4 introduced a number of changes to make the game flow faster than in previous sets.[CR]- Number of frames before the level completion time is shown changed from 32 to 8.[CR]- Number of frames after a time bonus is calculated changed from 128 to 64.[CR]- Number of frames before the screen wipes after the player has died changed from 128 to a single frame.[CR]Additional changes were made in Set 2:[CR]- Delay before player can move at the start of a stage changed from 64 frames to 16 frames.[CR]- Delay before the next level loads after an intermission changed from 64 frames to 16 frames.[CR]- Delay before the sky rapidly changes colors in the intro changed from 64 frames to 48 frames.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Smashing an ice block : 30 points. [CR]Smashing an ice block with a Sno-Bee inside : 500 points. [CR]Walking over a stunned Snow-Bee : 100 points. [CR]Killing a Snow-Bee with an ice block : 400 points. [CR]Killing two Snow-Bees at once with one ice block : 1600 points. [CR]Killing three Snow-Bees at once with one ice block : 3200 points. [CR]Killing four Snow-Bees at once with one ice block : 6400 points. [CR]Lining up the three diamond blocks with one or zero of them touching a wall : 10000 points.[CR]Lining up the three diamond blocks with two or more touching a wall : 5000 points.[CR]Completing screen in under 20 seconds : 5000 bonus points. [CR]Completing screen in 20-29 seconds : 2000 bonus points. [CR]Completing screen in 30-39 seconds : 1000 bonus points. [CR]Completing screen in 40-49 seconds : 500 bonus points. [CR]Completing screen in 50-59 seconds : 10 bonus points. [CR]Completing screen in 60 seconds and over : no bonus points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* The last remaining Sno-Bee on the screen will try to escape. If you do not kill it before it reaches one of the corners it will disappear.[CR]* The indicator at the top of the screen tells you how many Sno-Bees are remaining on the level, including those still in ice blocks.[CR]* At the start of each level some ice blocks will flash. This indicates that there is a Sno-Bee inside and you can destroy the ice block to kill the Sno-Bee before it emerges.[CR]* When you kill the last Sno-Bee you have a couple of seconds to crush up to four ice blocks for an extra 30 points each.[CR]* Concentrate your efforts on lining up the diamond blocks. The 10000 points are the biggest single score in the game, and stunning all the Sno-Bees is also a valuable side effect. You can then kill them easily by pushing ice blocks onto them rather than running over them (400 points as opposed to 100).[CR]* Lining up the three diamond have another side effect: the remaining ice blocks with a Sno-Bee inside will be flash to the end of screen.[CR]* Try to kill more than one Sno-Bee at a time, as two or more together are worth more points than killing them individually.[CR]* Easter Egg: In the attract mode, push the two joys to up, press the two action buttons and one button of start game, and it will show the credits of the game. After a few seconds, the game will reset. The wait can be stopped pushing the 1P Start button.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Pengo (1982)[CR]2. Pengo! (2010)[CR]3.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Phoenix</title_clean>
				<plot>Phoenix (c) 1980 Amstar.[CR]Phoenix is a classic vertical shoot-em-up in the mould of Taito's "Space Invaders" and Namco's "Galaxian", but takes the concept further with the introduction of progressive stages of play (instead of simply repeating a single playfield over and over with an increasing difficulty level). [CR]The player pilots a lone ship that can only move left and right along the botton of the playfield and fire upwards. The ship can also utilize a temporary 'Force Field' to protect it from missiles and birds. Any birds that that collide with the Force Field are destroyed. The Force Field only lasts for two seconds, but then cannot be used again for another five seconds. [CR]There are five attack waves to each round of play. [CR]The first wave begins with a formation of sixteen birds attacking the player's ship. They drop missiles and dive at the ship in an effort to destroy it. [CR]The second wave is a variation of the first, only with a different enemy attack pattern. [CR]The third wave begins with pattern of eight eggs that hatch into blue Phoenix birds that then attack the player's ship. These birds can be destroyed by rocket fire from the ship. If the rocket hits the bird on center, the bird is destroyed. If the rocket hits the bird to the left or right of center, only that wing of the bird is destroyed. The wing will regenerate itself if the bird is not quickly destroyed. [CR]The fourth wave is similar to the third, only with two banks of eggs instead of one. [CR]The fifth and final wave is the attack of the Space fortress mothership; a huge mothership piloted by a purple-coloured Alien Queen who sends down waves of small birds to attack the player's ship, as well as launching missiles from the mothership itself. The Alien Queen is protected by a barrier that must be shot several times before both the Queen and the mothership are destroyed.[CR]Once the mothership has been destroyed, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.[CR]The additional gameplay elements seem to be at the expense of hardware performance. Despite having more basic graphics than "Galaxian", Phoenix's ships move in a very mechanical fashion compared to the smooth, nicely animated movements of Namco's classic.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Most Phoenix games will be in a standard Centuri woodgrain cabinet, but several other cabinets exist, due to this game being sold by multiple companies at the same time. These use sticker sideart (which covers the upper half of the machine), and glass marquees. The control panel is made up entirely of buttons, no joysticks are present (on the upright and 'maxi' cabs, that is; the cocktail cab has a 2-way joystick and 2 buttons). The monitor in this machine is mounted vertically, and the monitor bezel is relatively unadorned. Phoenix uses a unique wiring harness, which isn't know to be compatible with any other games.[CR]Main CPU : 8085A[CR]Sound Chips : TMS36XX, Discrete circuitry[CR]Players : 2[CR]Cocktail cab : [CR]Control : 2-way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [1] Fire, [2] Force Field[CR]Upright and 'Maxi' cabs : [CR]Buttons : 4 (LEFT, RIGHT, FIRE, FORCE FIELD)[CR](The upright and 'maxi' cabs have no joystick)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Titlescreen's copyright notice :[CR]PHOENIX COPYRIGHT 1980[CR]AMSTAR ELECTRONICS CORP.[CR]PHOENIX AZ. U.S.A.[CR]Phoenix was released in December 1980.[CR]Phoenix was the first multi-level space shooter and also the first shooter to include bosses. Despite its hardware issues, Phoenix's many gameplay innovations ensured that it now is rightly regarded as a classic and, along with Taito's "Space Invaders" and Namco's "Pac-Man" shares the dubious honour of being one of the most cloned games of the 1980s; with numerous console and home computer 'tributes' appearing.[CR]The song that is played at the start of the game is 'Romance de Amor', also known as 'Spanish Romance', whose true author is currently unknown.[CR]The song that is played when you start over after the mothership is destroyed is Ludwig van Beethoven's 'F&#252;r Elise'.[CR]Mark Gotfraind holds the official record for this game with 987,620 points.[CR]Licensed releases:[CR]"Phoenix [Maxi model]" (Centuri, Inc.)[CR]"Phoenix [Upright model]" (Centuri, Inc.)[CR]"Phoenix [Japanese Cocktail Table]" (Taito Corp.)[CR]Known Bootlegs/Hacks :[CR]Phoenix (Irecsa G.G.I Corp.)[CR]Phoenix (T.P.N.)[CR]Griffon (Videotron)[CR]Falcon (BGV)[CR]Vautour (Jeutel)[CR]Condor (Sidam)[CR]Batman Part 2[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring is a little complicated in this game due to the fact it depends on hits made and how close the Phoenix's are to your fighter.[CR]Phoenix fighters : 20, 40, or 80 points; 200 points if flying as a bird.[CR]Phoenix birds : 50 or 100 points/egg, 100 - 800 points/bird (depends on how many wings shot off and distance from fighter).[CR]Mothership : 1,000 - 9,000 points (may depend on how close the mothership is to you fighter when you kill the Alien Queen; may also depend on the amount of damage to the mothership, speed of destruction, as well as the number of spaceships destroyed). Usually, first 9 spaceships would increase by a thousand, then will be followed by nine 9000 point spaceships, then back to the first nine set, etc...[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your fighter will be in the middle at the bottom of the screen. You will see a formation of enemy fighters at the top of the screen. This is the beginning of Wave 1. A quick note about the Force Field: it lasts a couple of seconds and takes about five seconds to regenerate again.[CR]WAVES 1 AND 2 :[CR]1) You will usually be attacked by multiple fighters at any one time. The movements of these fighters is pretty random.[CR]2) In addition to dropping bombs on your fighter, Phoenix fighters also tend to try to ram your fighter.[CR]3) After you clear out a few fighters, they will reassemble at the top of the screen. They will then move in synch with each other as they creep to the bottom of the screen.[CR]4) Sometimes a Phoenix fighter will hover right above your ship. If you're quick, you can get off a quick shot and move away before a bomb can be dropped on you.[CR]5) If multiple Phoenix fighters are at your level, use the Force Field to clear a path through them.[CR]WAVE 3 AND 4 :[CR]1) The Phoenixes in Wave 3 enter the screen in a zig-zag pattern while the Phoenixes in Wave 4 arrive in a cross-over pattern of four Phoenixes per side.[CR]2) Once they get large, they start to do erratic zig-zag patterns across the screen. At the same time, they are dropping bombs toward your fighter. Your goal is to shoot off their wings. If you do this, it forces them to go straight down until the wing regenerates. They will still be dropping bombs, but at least they will be going straight down.[CR]3) If at all possible, try to hit the Phoenixes when they are close to your ship. Doing this gets you more points.[CR]4) In addition, try to shoot off both wings before destroying a Phoenix for more points.[CR]WAVE 5 :[CR]1) Your goal on this wave is to cut through the mothership's hull and shield and take out the Alien Queen inside.[CR]2) Start firing as rapidly as you can to quickly cut through the hull. It will take quite a few shots to get to the shield.[CR]3) The shield rotates so you will have to hit it a lot of times in order to get a wide enough hole in it to hit the Alien Queen.[CR]4) As all of this is going on, the mothership is continually descending upon your ship. In addition, the escorts are constantly harassing you.[CR]5) A good strategy is that once you have cut a path through the hull and shield, wait for the mothership to be almost on top of your ship. When you take out the alien, you will get a lot more points.[CR]6) Destroying the escorts does not end this wave. Once you complete Wave 5, the cycle begins anew.[CR]* During the game three birds will attack all in a line. Let those birds fly all the way to the bottom and start to fly back up. As they are flying up, shoot all three in a row real quick (2 or 3 seconds) and you will elevate your score to 204,000 regardless of what your current score is - The best way to get this bonus for shooting the three birds in a line is on the second stage of level 2. The blue and pink birds in an oval shape. Just wait, not firing at the bottom of the screen. A single bird will come down, fanny around and then fly back up, then four birds will fly down together in a line. When they start to fly back up - blast three of them for the bonus. It works best here because of the rapid fire allowed on this and every other 2nd stage. In addition, accomplishing the trick a second time again puts your score at 204,000, even if your score was higher.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Phoenix (1980)[CR]2.

				<plot>Pooyan (c) 1982 Konami Industry Company, Limited.[CR]The player takes on the role of a bow-and-arrow welding pig who must protect her piglets from the pack of hungry wolves ballooning up or down the cliff face. The pig is suspended in a winch-controlled cage and must move vertically up and down, shooting the balloons and sending the wolves plummeting to the ground. Any wolves she misses will, having safely reached the ground, climb a ladder to try and bite her. Also, if any of the wolves reach the ground, more piglets will be captured by them. Mother Pig must try to kill as many wolves as possible without letting them reach the ground.[CR]On the second level, the wolves use balloons to float upwards to the top of a high cliff. If enough of them reach the cliff, they will push a huge boulder down onto Mother Pig's cage. After this level has been completed, the piglets who have been captured are rescued and the game starts over with increased difficulty.[CR]There is also a bonus round where Mother Pig will attempt to eliminate as many wolves on ascending balloons as possible by throwing as few slabs of meat as possible for a maximum bonus score.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX320[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), (6x) RC (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-way joystick (vertical)[CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Pooyan was released in October 1982. [CR]The title is Japanese for 'little pigs'. It is also very rarely used as an adjective meaning 'extremely stupid'. For example, 'Intentionally puncturing your spacesuit is pooyan'. [CR]The intro tune is a rendition of "The Other Day I Met a Bear" which is a traditional American camp song. The music was composed in 1919 by Carey Morgan and Lee David.[CR]The Round 1 in-game tune is a rendition of 'Humoresque (Op. 101, No. 7 in G flat major)' by Antonin Dvorak. [CR]Mark Kinter holds the official record for this game with 1609250 points. [CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Pootan".

				<plot>Puckman (c) 1980 Namco.[CR]Puckman is the seminal and hugely influential arcade game in which the player guides the legendary Puckman around a single-screen maze eating dots. Puckman is constantly pursued in his task by four colored ghosts. Each ghost has its own unique personality and behavioural patterns and a single touch from any of the ghosts results in Puckman losing a life. When all of Puckman's lives are lost, the game is over.[CR]Power pills are situated in each corner of the rectangular maze and eating one of these makes Puckman temporarily invincible; the four ghosts also change to dark blue in color and can now be eaten by Puckman. But watch out...a flashing blue ghost indicates that the power pill is about to wear off and the ghosts are about to transform back to their former selves again. Once Puckman eats a blue ghost, this 'skinned' ghost then becomes visible as a pair of eyes only, will return to the ghost pen in the middle of the maze, regenerate into its former self, and return to the maze to continue its pursuit of Puckman. [CR]Each maze contains 240 dots and 4 power pills, and all must be eaten to complete the level; whereupon the entire sequence begins again with an increased level of difficulty (the action increases in speed and power pills decrease in effectiveness). [CR]Twice in every level, a bonus fruit or prize item will temporarily appear in the middle of the maze below the ghost pen. Puckman can eat these bonus items to receive extra points. Also, there is an escape tunnel on each side of the maze that Puckman can use to escape any ghosts that are currently closing in on him. The ghosts can also use the tunnel, but take longer to pass through it than Puckman, making escape a little easier. [CR]Between certain rounds, funny intermissions will be played featuring Puckman and the ghosts in funny situations. Three intermissions are present: [CR]1) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen and off the side. Then he re-appears running in the opposite direction, having turned blue, followed by a giant Puckman! This intermission is played after Round 2. [CR]2) The red ghost is again chasing Puckman, but this time he rips his red sheet on a nail on the ground, and we can see his pink body under the sheet! This intermission is played after Round 5. [CR]3) The red ghost chases Puckman across the screen once more, this time with his sheet sewn. They disappear at the left side and then the ghost reappears coming back the opposite direction. This time he is bare and drags his sheet behind him. This intermission is played after Rounds 9, 13 and 17. [CR]No intermission is present between rounds after the 18th one.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]The original Namco Puckman Upright model came in a white cabinet that may look familiar to most gamers. This cabinet is the same 'swoopy' design used for Pac-Man and Galaxian. The only actual design difference was the coin door. The Japanese version had a tall coin door with a single coin mech, while the U.S. version, Pac-Man, had a fat coin door with two coin mechs installed. However, the graphics on the Japanese machine were completely different from those of the U.S. machine. The marquee had the 'Puckman' logo off to the right-hand side at an angle, and showed a scene with half a dozen cartoon Puckmen eating power pellets, with a few ghosts lingering off to the side. The monitor bezel was largely red and was of a circular design and had many Puckmen lounging around the perimeter of the circle. The control panel continued the reddish graphics and had instructions in Japanese, along with a yellow ball-top 4-Way joystick and Start buttons for each player. The sideart was a large circular sticker that advertised the game's name, and had many cartoon Puckmen in action around the edges of the circle, with the word Namco displayed prominently at the bottom. The cabinet was finished off with yellow t-molding on the edges. [CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]The game was first introduced to the Japanese arcade market in May 1980 and caught the hearts and imaginations of the public like no other game before it, and few since. It is still regarded as the hallmark of the 'golden age' of video games and an icon of 1980's popular culture. [CR]The game was originally known in Japan as Puckman, but due to the West's predilection with changing words to vulgarities by scratching part of the word off (in this case, changing the word 'Puck' to something rather less socially acceptable by scratching off part of the letter 'P'), the name was changed to "Pac-Man" for its release to the American arcade market in October 1980. The name 'Pac-Man' comes from the Japanese slang term 'paku-paku', which describes the motion of the mouth opening and closing during eating and translates to English as 'to eat'. [CR]Toru Iwatani, author and designer of Puckman: "Puckman's character is difficult to explain even to the Japanese -- he is an innocent character. He hasn't been educated to discern between good and evil. He acts more like a small child than a grown-up person. Think of him as a child learning in the course of his daily activities. If someone tells him guns are evil, he would be the type to rush out and eat guns. But he would most probably eat any gun, even the pistols of policemen who need them." [CR]Puckman was, quite literally, conceived at lunchtime. Iwatani, then in his mid 20s, was very hungry and ordered himself a pizza for lunch. He took one slice, and, looking at the rest of the pizza, Puckman was born. However, in later years, Iwatini has suggested the shape was based on the Japanese character 'kuchi', meaning mouth. He rounded off this shape, and created the classic shape. The game took 1 1/2 years to complete and had five people on its team. Puckman is the greatest selling arcade game of all time and is arguably also the world's most recognized video-game character of all time. It had its own cartoon, lunch box, board game, stickers and hundreds of other products. This was largely due to Puckman being the first truly distinctive video-game 'character', and it changed the face of video games forever. Puckman was the first video game to be as equally popular to women as it was with men. [CR]* A place in video game history: "Pac-Man is the most universally known arcade game," said Chris Lindsey, director of the National Video Game and Coin-Op Museum in St. Louis. "Everybody knows about Pac-Man. And, I've noticed, almost everybody can play Pac-Man pretty well. Pac-Man makes just about the best use of the joystick one can imagine. It's so intuitive that it puts other games to shame in terms of how easy it is for a person to walk up, stick a quarter in the machine, and start doing something meaningful. At the time, Pac-Man introduced a completely unique style of game play and was also highly identifiable in terms of its music. With Pac-Man, everything was there. The video game industry needs another game that captures the public's heart like Pac-Man, and so far, no one has been able to come up with it." [CR]* The great 25-cent escape: "People expect to see Pac-Man when they come into the museum, and without fail, when they see it, they want to play it," Lindsey said. "People remember spending hours and hours at Pac-Man. They like to see how good they are now when they play it. And I would say that, perhaps more than any other game, the same playing skills still apply. Perhaps it's because of the intuitive game play. You don't have to memorize the behavior of a wide array of enemies as you do with some other games. You just have to remember that when the ghosts turn blue, you only have seconds, until they start seriously blinking, to go and get them. And Pac-Man is a little looser in its style of game play - more open. For instance, you can kill time in the lower left hand corner until you see an opening between the ghosts, and you can strategize a bit more: You can play with the tunnels, you can play with the position of the ghosts in relation to the energizers. Even people who haven't played in years remember those strategies."[CR]After all these years, the challenge of Pac-Man still remains. [CR]"You can also get into some really fun jams, when you've got a ghost on your tail and you have to make a decision about whether you're going to go left, or right, or straight at the next junction, which is in .03 seconds," Lindsey said. "It gets to be pretty tense, especially when those ghosts start moving really fast and the energizers aren't lasting as long. Pac-Man can be a real heart-thumping game." [CR]After the 255th level, Puckman/Pac-Man presents the player with the infamous 'split-screen' level, where the left-half of the screen is normal, but the right-half of the screen is garbled with a mess of letters, numbers, symbols and other graphics. This level cannot be completed because there are not enough dots on screen to be eaten! This is the result of a bug in the routine drawing the fruits at the bottom of the screen, according to the round number. Indeed, the code works as follows: [CR]1) it increases the last round number by one; [CR]2) it checks if the result is smaller than 8 (in this case, you still would not have enough fruits to fill the line and some blank space must be drawn); [CR]3) it checks if the result is larger than 19 (in this case, it has only to draw keys); [CR]4) finally, it fills the bottom bar with the correct fruits. [CR]In particular, if the round number is smaller than 8, the game draws as many fruits as the previous round number. This produces an undesirable effect right after the 255th level. [CR]Indeed, 256 = 255+1 becomes 00 for the CPU (which expects to use the last 2 hexadecimal digits only, and 256 = 100 in hex)! [CR]Therefore, the game thinks to be in one of the first 7 levels (because 0 is smaller than 7), but it tries to draw 255 fruits (because the last round number was 255). Of course, there is no space for that many fruits to be displayed and the game starts to draw garbage on the main screen. [CR]Fixing the original code (either through a cheat in emulation, or hacking the roms on the PCB) would results in a 256th level identical to the first one (cherries will appear) but harder, since ghosts will behave as they do in levels beyond the 19th. [CR]The alien spaceship "Galaxian" makes an appearance as the prize in the 9th and 10th boards. [CR]Note : Excluding bootlegs, there are 23 different name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in Puckman/Pac-Man (29 including 'Sue' from "Ms. Pac-Man", 'Tim' from "Jr. Pac-Man", 'Common' and 'Grey Common' from the Japanese version of "Pac-Mania", and 'Funky' and 'Spunky' from the American version of "Pac-Mania"). [CR]'Galaxian' boards will run in Pac-Man machines, but the sound pinout is different, so the pinout at the connector would have to be modified. To fire, one would have to press UP on the joystick. [CR]Billy Mitchell, Rick Fothergill, Chris Ayra, Tim Balderramos and Donald Hayes all hold the official record for this game on 'Regular (TGTS)' settings with a perfect score of 3,333,360 points on July 3, 1999, July 31, 1999, February 16, 2000, December 4, 2004 and July 21, 2005, respectively. [CR]Chris Ayra holds the official record for the fastest time to get a perfect game on 'Regular' settings with 3:42:05 on April 2, 2002. [CR]Ron Corcoran holds the official record for this game on 'Speedup' settings with 1,321,020 points on May 13, 2001.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The attract mode's title sequence introduces the ghosts with name/nickname combinations displayed on the upper half of the screen. [CR]The default name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in the original Japanese version are : [CR]Oikake - "Akabei" (translation: Chaser - "Red Guy") (red ghost)[CR]Machibuse - "Pinky" (translation: Ambusher - "Pink Guy") (pink ghost)  [CR]Kimagure - "Aosuke" (translation: Fickle - "Blue Guy") (cyan ghost) [CR]Otoboke - "Guzuta" (translation: Stupid - "Slow Guy") (orange ghost)  [CR]The Japanese version also has a DIP switch for alternate name/nickname combinations for the ghosts. These alternate names are : [CR]Urchin - "Macky" (red ghost) [CR]Romp - "Micky" (pink ghost) [CR]Stylist - "Mucky" (cyan ghost) [CR]Crybaby - "Mocky" (orange ghost) [CR]The name/nickname combinations for the ghosts in the North American version are : [CR]Shadow - "Blinky" (red ghost)[CR]Speedy - "Pinky" (pink ghost)[CR]Bashful - "Inky" (cyan ghost)[CR]Pokey - "Clyde" (orange ghost)[CR]Unlike the Japanese version, the American version has no DIP switch for alternate ghost names.[CR]ADDITIONAL NOTES: [CR]In Japan Set 3: [CR]* At the top of the title screen, instead of 'Nickname', it says 'Ghost'. [CR]* The 'Press Start' screen displays 1981 as the year of release, instead of 1980.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Dot : 10 points. [CR]Power pill (energizer) : 50 points. [CR]Ghosts : 200, 400, 800, 1,600 points. [CR]Cherry : 100 points. [CR]Strawberry : 300 points. [CR]Peach : 500 points. [CR]Apple : 700 points. [CR]Pineapple : 1,000 points. [CR]Galaxian : 2,000 points. [CR]Bell : 3,000 points. [CR]Key : 5,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* The number of lives Puckman starts with depends on the 'Lives' dip switch setting (1, 2, 3, or 5; the default is 3).[CR]* An extra life is awarded based on the 'Extra Lives' dip switch setting (10,000, 15,000, 20,000, or None; the default is 10,000). [CR]* Fruits appear twice on each board. The first fruit appears after Puckman has eaten 70 dots; the second fruit appears once there are only 70 dots remaining in the maze. [CR]* At the beginning of a round, the ghosts won't immediately pursue Puckman. Use this time the best as you can. [CR]* Puckman can turn corners faster than the ghosts can, so turning many corners can help you escape ghosts. [CR]* The tunnel allows Pac-Man and the ghosts to instantly travel from one side of the maze to the other. While traveling through the tunnel, Puckman moves at normal speed, but the ghosts' speed is reduced in half. This provides Puckman with a good opportunity to put some distance between him and the ghosts, but be careful not to get trapped by another ghost entering the opposite side. [CR]* Stall Puckman from entering the tunnel and then, just before the ghosts reach him, send him through the tunnel. By attracting the ghosts to one side of the screen, you reduce Puckman's chances of meeting them when he emerges on the other side of the screen.[CR]* If you hold the joystick in a direction that is blocked by a wall, Puckman will turn in that direction as soon as he reaches a passage leading in that direction. Remember this to turn corners as fast as you can. [CR]* Remember that eating dots will slow Puckman down a little bit: avoid parts of the maze in which you've not been yet if you are trying to escape ghosts! [CR]* Try not to eat power pills until the ghosts are near. The longer Puckman waits, the closer the ghosts get, and the easier it is for Puckman to eat them once they have turned blue. [CR]* Mind that, as the levels increases, the ghost speed increases as well! [CR]* In later rounds, you're not going to be able to eat ghosts after eating a power pill, because the vulnerability time decreases to zero. This is when you need to learn how to avoid the ghosts understanding their movement and their moving patterns! [CR]* Right above the ghost pen, there are two paths leading upward to the upper part of the maze. The ghosts never travel upward through these holes while they're in their normal forms; they only do while they're blue after Puckman has eaten a power pill. Indeed, they only exit the area around the ghost pen from the sides or the bottom. These are not completely safe corners, since ghosts can travel downward through them, anyway they often represents a safe passage to flee from ghosts pursuing you around the ghost pen. [CR]* Ghosts' Movements : First of all, remember that ghosts are not always following you! Their movements follow two distinct phases: one in which they avoid Puckman and one in which they hunt him down. In the former phase, each ghost patrols his personal corner of the maze. In the latter one, they will try to find Puckman, following their personal 'behavior': [CR]1) The red ghost tends to patrol the top-right corner of the maze and he follows Puckman always trying to minimize their respective distance. [CR]2) The pink ghost tends to patrol the top-left corner of the maze and he follows Puckman trying to reach a position slightly in front of Puckman, in the direction he's moving. [CR]3) The cyan ghost tends to patrol the bottom-right corner of the maze and he has the most complicated AI since he moves towards a point determined by both Puckman's position and the red ghost's position. [CR]4) The orange ghost tends to patrol the bottom-left corner of the maze and he only tries to be close to Puckman, without hunting him directly. [CR]Ghosts alternate these two different behaviors (hiding and hunting) a few times in each round, then they start to pursue Puckman restlessly until all the dots are eaten, or they manage to catch him. [CR]Additionally, as soon as a certain number of dots has been cleared from the maze (this number decreases as the levels pass), the red ghost's speed will increase and he won't stop to search for Puckman anymore.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Punch-Out!! (c) 1984 Nintendo.[CR]The player assumes the role of a green-haired boxer, who must fight his way through six increasingly larger-than-life boxers to earn the title of 'Champ' in this superb 1-on-1 fighting game.[CR]During matches, the player's boxer is viewed from behind as a wire-frame (so the player's opponent can be seen). Players must time their punches, dodges and blocks in order to defeat the opposing boxer.[CR]The player's opponents are each rendered as humorous cartoon-like caricatures - adding much to the game's atmosphere - and each boxer fights in a slightly different style, forcing players to adapt to their strategy. The top monitor is used for statistics while the bottom one is used to display the actual fight.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game No. CHP1-UP[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zetex N2A03 (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Zetex N2A03 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), Sanyo VLM5030 (@ 3.58 Mhz)[CR]Players : 1[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; [1] LEFT BLOW, [2] RIGHT BLOW, [3] KNOCKOUT BLOW[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Punch-Out!! was released in February 1984 in the arcades.[CR]Punch-Out!!'s innovative game-play and memorable graphics and speech did much to ensure its popularity throughout the 1980s.[CR]The game's title music, is actually the 'Gillette Look Sharp March'. This jingle, originally heard in Gillette radio and television commercials, was later used as the theme song to the Gillette Cavalcade of Sports, which aired boxing matches. The music can also be heard in the 1980 boxing related film 'Raging Bull' during the scene where Jake LaMotta (as played by Robert De Niro) unveils his new nightclub.[CR]Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong and Donkey Kong Jr. appear as spectators in the crowd - on both sides of the ring.[CR]Rac Carpana holds the official record for this game with 15,999,990 points.[CR]A Punch-Out!! arcade unit can be seen in the 1987 movie 'Over the Top'.[CR]A Game &amp; Watch version was also released the same year under the title 'Boxing'. It was renamed to 'Punch-Out!!' for it's special 1988 U.S. release.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Control Panel Instructions : [CR]- Power meter indicates your punching power. Build up your punching power by punching the champ, throw a knock-out blow when meter flashes "KO".[CR]- Status meter indicates your/champ's respective stamina, knockdown occurs when status meter reads empty.[CR]- Game is over when you are knocked out or time counts down to zero.[CR]- "Lets keep it clean. Now come out boxing!"[CR]* Here's the system for getting by everyone in 1 round of Punch-Out (warning : This system works on 9 out of 10 Punch-Out machines)...[CR]1) Glass Joe : So easy that you'd have to be trying not to win. But to be 100% sure... Keep guard up till his eyes glow for a big punch, dodge, and hammer him with rights and lefts to the face. Repeat till down.[CR]2) Piston Hurricane : Concentrate blows, especially lefts, to the abdomen. When he backs up and charges in, hit him with a blow to the stomach as soon as he charges into you, he'll go down for the count after the 2nd or third time.[CR]3) Bald Bull : Fairly simple : Right, dodge, left left. Right, dodge left left. Look out for his upper cuts though (get out of the way! duh) and upon his bull-charge you have two options. A hit to the stomach when he is right under you puts him down for the count, but if your reflexes aren't optimum, you are better off at dodging and continuing the fight. Right to the face (or 2 lefts), dodge, right. NO BODY BLOWS TO BALD BULL except on the bull charge.[CR]4) Kid Quick : Soooo easy : Right, dodge, right right dodge right right dodge right right dodge right right dodge right right (these all being blows to the head). VERY EASY as long as you don't lose your rhythm. If ya do get messed up you can usually recover with a a dodge and starting again. No blows to the stomach. This is basically what you'll be doing against Mr. Sandman.[CR]5) Pizza Pasta : Basically you're waiting for him to screw up. Use the kid quick system till he backs off (with the Come on! Come on!) and DODGE his hook. Then pummel him with rights and lefts to the head (ONLY the head), and he won't be fighting back. Repeat till he's dead. If he pins you up against the ropes with shots to the stomach at some point, just get your guard down there and sneak in some lefts and you should break free.[CR]6) Mr. Sandman, the champion : Kid Quick system exactly. Every now and then however he fires a very quick left or right to the head. When he hits you with one, dodge the opposite way of the hit quickly or you'll be going down.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Q*bert</title_clean>
				<plot>Q*bert (c) 1982 Gottlieb.[CR]The object of the Q*bert game is to change the color of the top of the cubes to the Destination color indicated at the upper-left corner of the screen (below Player 1's score) by hopping onto them. When all the cubes in the pyramid have been changed to the Destination color, the screen will advance to the next round, with the player-controlled Q*bert character starting back on the top cube. At the beginning of each Level, there will be a short demonstration cycle with Q*bert hopping around four cubes to explain to the player the play action of each Level. Each level consists of four Rounds. The current level number and round number is displayed at the upper-right corner of the screen (below Player 2's score in a 2-player game).[CR]The game play starts with Q*bert appearing at the top of the pyramid. The joystick will move Q*bert from cube to cube by hopping in any of four diagonal directions. Q*bert can move anywhere on the pyramid, but jumping off will kill him. Hopping on the rotating disk will take Q*bert back to the top of the pyramid. In the first two Rounds of play, Q*bert will have to avoid touching the red and purple balls. These deadly objects drop randomly onto the second-from-the-top level and bounce downwards. The red balls will fall off the bottom, but the purple ball will stop at the bottom and hatch into Coily, the snake which chases Q*bert. To destroy Coily, lure him to the edge, then jump unto a disk. The disk will take Q*bert back to the top and Coily will fall off, awarding 500 points and clearing the board of all other 'nasty' characters.[CR]Starting at the 3rd Round of play, other 'nasty' characters come into play. The green characters or objects are safe to hop onto and will award points. All other 'nasty' characters are deadly to touch. In the third Round the red balls will stop falling, but two purple characters named Ugg and Wrong Way will appear at the lower portion of the pyramid and travel sideways and upwards (Ugg is the one with the snout moving from right to left on the right sides of the cubes, and Wrong Way is the one with the big eyes moving from left to right on the left sides of the cubes). They will not chase Q*bert, but will move randomly to get in Q*bert's way. In the third Round and every Round after, based on an internal timer, a green ball will appear and bounce down from the top of the pyramid. Hopping Q*bert onto the green ball will award 100 points, and freeze all the characters on the screen for a few seconds, but 'Q*bert' will still be able to move to complete the color changes.[CR]During the 4th Round of play, two green characters named Slick and Sam will appear, based on the internal timer (Slick is the one wearing shades; Sam does not wear shades, otherwise their function is identical). They will drop onto the second level from the top and hop randomly downwards. If they hop onto a cube that Q*bert has already changed the color of, the cube will change to a different color to thwart Q*Bert. Hopping Q*Bert onto Slick or Sam will stop them and award 300 points.[CR]Throughout the remaining Rounds, all the characters and objects will appear in random combinations with increasing speed.[CR]To add variety to the game, the disks will change positions every Round, and in the higher Levels the number of disks will change.[CR]During Level 2, the play action will increase in difficulty from changing the cubes to one color, to changing the color of the cubes twice. This mean: that each cube would have to be hopped on twice to change the pyramid to the destination color, completing the Round.[CR]Starting at Level 3 and for all remaining Rounds, and Levels, the play action will become more difficult. The object remains to change the cubes to the Destination color, but if Q*Bert hops on any cube, that cube will change color. So even if the cube has already been changed to the Destination color, it will change again.[CR]Here is a rundown of how all the colors change :[CR]Legend :[CR]S - Starting Color[CR]I - Intermediate Color[CR]D - Destination color[CR]LEVEL 1 : When Q*bert jumps on S or I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D (NOTE : During the 4th round, when Slick/Sam jumps on D, it changes to I).[CR]LEVEL 2 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it stays at D.[CR]LEVEL 3 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.[CR]LEVEL 4 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to I. Q*bert must start again.[CR]LEVEL 5 : When Q*bert jumps on S, it changes to I. When he jumps on I, it changes to D. When he jumps on D, it changes back to S. Q*bert must start again.[CR]LEVELS 6-9 : Same color pattern as Level 5. The difference is the increased speed of Q*bert and the 'nasty' characters.[CR]There are also bonus points awarded at the end of each round for successfully completing the round. The bonus for the completion of the 1st round is 1000 points. This Bonus will progressively increase each Round by 250 points to a maximum of 5000 points at Level 5.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GV-103[CR]Main CPU : I8086 (@ 5 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 894.886 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : DAC, Votrax SC-01[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick (diagonal)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Q*bert was released in October 1982.[CR]Licensed to Konami for Japanese distribution (February 1983).[CR]Inspired by artwork by M.C. Escher who was an artist that Jeff admired. Ron Waxman came up with the idea of Q*bert changing the color of the cubes. Q*bert's name originated by the combination of 'Cube' and 'Hubert', but the 'Cube-Bert' was changed to 'Q-bert' to make it more unique. The concept game was called 'Snots and Boogers' and then '@!#?@!' (which many of the programmers and Gottlieb VPs said would be impossible to get anyone to say) before the final version was called just 'Q*bert'. Slick and Sam were a play on the phrase 'spick and span' with Sam being named after co-worker Sam Russo. Rick Tighe came up with the idea of adding the pinball hardware which generated the very mechanical KA-CHUNK when Q*bert falls off the pyramid.[CR]A Votrax SC-01 speech synthesis chip is used to generate the incoherent speech of Q*bert swearing, Slick and Sam (high pitch) and Wrong-way and Ugg (low pitch). The only true speech ever generated is Q*bert saying 'Hello, I'm turned on' when the game is first powered up and 'Bye Bye' after entering your initials at the end of a game.[CR]Approximately 30000 units were produced by Gottlieb.[CR]Several early cabinets were produced with '@!#?@!' on the marquee.[CR]Bob Gerhardt holds the official records for this game in 'Marathon' setting with 33273520 points on November 28, 1983.[CR]Tom Gault holds the official records for this game in 'Tournament' setting with 1,895,565 points.[CR]A slightly different version known as 'Mello Yello' was programmed for promotion of the Mellow-Yellow softdrink, but it was never released to the market.[CR]As well as being a huge commercial success as a game, Q*bert also provided revenue from its many tie-in products. Toys, games, and other products bearing the hero&#8217;s likeness all sold well. There was even a Q*bert cartoon; Saturday Supercade was a CBS cartoon series which featured a number of different segments starring various video game characters. In addition to the characters from the game, the Q*Bert segment featured Q*tee (Q*bert's girlfriend), Q*bit (his little brother), and others.[CR]Such was the character's popularity at this time that Gottlieb assigned pinball designer, John Trudeau ("Creature From the Black Lagoon", "Congo"), to devise a Q*bert pinball. It was called "Q*bert's Quest" and Trudeau created an innovative design pattern that should have sparked arcade goers to try it. Remarkably, the table was a commercial flop. Released in March 1983, a paltry 884 machines dribbled out of the plant and further convinced management that pinball was indeed experiencing desperate times.[CR]A Q*bert unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Koyaanisqatsi - Life out of Balance'.[CR]Parker Brothers released a boardgame based on this videogame (same name) in 1983 : Object of the game is to be one of the 'NOSER ELITE' by removing more pegs from the pyramid than your opponent (Peg plugged into cube = Starting color; Peg removed from cube = Destination color).[CR]One player takes on the role of the hero, Q*bert, who must make his way around the pyramid trying to remove as many pegs as he can. A second player controls the 'nasty' characters out to thwart Q*bert.[CR]The main characters make an appearance on the 2012 animation movie "Wreck-It Ralph" from Walt Disney Animation Studios.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Changing a cube to the Intermediate color : 15 points.[CR]Changing a cube to the Destination color : 25 points.[CR]Catching the Green Ball : 100 points[CR]Catching Slick/Sam : 300 points.[CR]Luring Coily off pyramid : 500 points bonus.[CR]Completing a round : 750 points + 250 points x round number.[CR]End of round bonus : 50 points per teleport disc remaining.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Control Panel Instructions :[CR]Goal : Change the tops of all cubes to a new color by hopping onto them.[CR]Joystick moves 'Q*bert' from cube to cube. Hopping onto a disk will take you back to the top.[CR]All green objects are safe to hit. All other objects are deadly.[CR]Destroy the snake by leading him to the edge, then jumping on a disk.[CR]Stay on pyramid! Only jump off to use a disk.[CR]* A big part of the game is waiting to see where 'nasty' characters are going to jump. You need to make sure you always time a jump at the same time the 'nasty' characters jump, so you can always have a clear path to a new square.[CR]* Since the game only has nine levels, if you can master Level 9 then you should be able to play indefinitely since Level 9 repeats once you reach it and the game doesn't get any harder.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Roc'n Rope</title_clean>
				<plot>Roc'n Rope (c) 1983 Konami.[CR]Roc'n Rope is an incredibly difficult yet playable platform game featuring four different levels. The player takes on the role of a an archaeologist whose mission is to return the missing tail feathers to the golden Phoenix. The archaeologist is armed with a harpoon gun and uses it to fire a rope into a platform above, in order to climb up the rope and progress up the level. This is vaguely similar to the superb 'telescopic arm' feature that appeared in Capcom's superb "Bionic Commando".[CR]All levels are patrolled by enemies in the form of dinosaurs and cavemen and all are deadly to the touch. Some cavemen will pull on the harpoon rope while the archaeologist is climbing it. This will result in the player falling from the rope and losing a life. The archaeologist is armed with a light ray that will kill the enemies.[CR]A breakdown of the game's four levels :[CR]* The first level is possibly the most difficult in the game. Players begin at the bottom left of the screen and must work their way up to the Roc, who is sitting at the upper right of the screen. There are many layers of ledges coming out from the sides of the screen. While the middle of the screen is open to the sky (except for a few floating platforms). To reach the top, players must use the harpoon gun to climb diagonally back and forth until they reach the top (ensuring that the Phoenix feathers have been collected on the way).[CR]* The second level is set underground. There are a lot of dinosaurs on this screen and far fewer platforms than on the first level. Many of the platforms stretch completely across the screen, so there aren't many pitfalls to be wary of. Once again, players must get the archaeologist to the top of the screen to complete the level.[CR]* The third level is set outdoors. A 'ferris wheel' style rotating platform sits in the center of the screen, but this can be avoided if players don't wish to use it. The easiest route to the top is on the right-hand side of the level.[CR]* The fourth and final level is shaped a little like a mountain. The player's main concern here is a large waterfall in the center of the screen. Players must time their harpoon climb just right to avoid being killed by the deadly waters. Once this level is finished, the game starts over with an increased level of difficulty.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Roc'n Rope was only available in an upright configuration. This upright was in a wood-grained cabinet that was similar in construction to the "Frogger" cabinet. The sideart was a large sticker showing an adventurer posing with a harpoon gun and a bird. The marquee shows this same adventurer firing his harpoon gun across a chasm at an unsuspecting dinosaur, while a cartoon caveman looks on suspiciously. The monitor bezel was unadorned, although most machines had a little instruction card underneath the glass. The control panel was a solid green and featured a single joystick mounted centrally, with two buttons to either side, which allowed for the game to be played with either hand.[CR]Game ID : GX364[CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1.6 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), (6x) RC (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Roc'n Rope was released in March 1983.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Learn the angle at which you throw the rope : The rope is thrown at a very shallow angle. The rope ends up hown long distances. Learning this angle is the first step to mastering this game.[CR]* Be careful of heights : If you fall a distance longer than the height of you character, that couns as a miss. Be careful when you fall.[CR]* Use the rope to beat enemies : If you cut the rope when the enemy is hanging from it, you can beat the enemy. Attacking with the rope is extremely fun.[CR]* Keep an eye on enemy movements : Right before the enemy moves up or down or hangs from the rope, the enemy always moves n a certain way. Learn the enemy's behavior and take action quickly.[CR]* Make good use of the power food : Not only do you become invincible when you obtain the power food, but you also speed up! While taking out enemies is a good idea, you may want to consider traveling the level instead.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Director: Tokuro Fujiwara[CR]Programmed by: H.

				<plot>Super Cobra (c) 1981 Konami.[CR]The object of the game is to invade ten SUPER COBRA defense systems of increasing difficulty and safely pick up the BOOTY.[CR]Use the joystick to move up, down, accelerate and decelerate. Use the Laser and Bombs to destroy defenders. Hitting tanks scores Mystery Value worth 100, 200, or 300 points. Rockets, Tanks, Missiles, and UFO's may all fire at invader. Hit fuel tanks for extra fuel for CHOPPER. The Chopper uses up fuel as it flies, except in between defense levels.[CR]At 10000 points, the player is awarded a BONUS CHOPPER.[CR]At the end of the game, the player can continue at the defense level he left off on by depositing extra coins and pressing the discharge button on the left-hand side of the panel.[CR]If the Booty is destroyed on the BASE level, the player may try again. When the Booty is safely recovered, a Bonus Chopper is awarded and play resumes at defense level Number 1 where the fuel is used up faster and the defenders fire more often.[CR]SUPER COBRA Defense Level Descriptions :[CR]*  Fuel Tanks appear on every defense level.[CR]*  Tanks appear and fire on all levels except level 8 where they do not fire.[CR]Level 1 - Player must maneuver the chopper over mountainous terrain against fast and slow firing rockets.[CR]Level 2 - Chopper faces Arcing missiles over a mountain terrain.[CR]Level 3 - Smart Bombs flying in groups of four over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Level 4 - Single Smart Bombs over mountainous terrain. Again, Rockets appear but do not fire.[CR]Level 5 - Chopper flies through a cavern-like terrain against Falling Mines.[CR]Level 6 - Rapidly firing, Roving Tanks over mountainous terrain. Rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Level 7 - Maneuver through a field of meteors which explode when hit with bombs or three times with Laser, plus a single, green, shadow meteor directly in front of Chopper which explodes when hit five times with Laser. Rockets appear but do not fire.[CR]Level 8 - Chopper flies over mountainous terrain against rapidly firing UFO's. Tanks and Rockets appear, but do not fire.[CR]Level 9 - Chopper faces arcing missiles over tall buildings.[CR]Level 10 - Firing rockets in a Building Maze.[CR]Base - Player must maneuver the Chopper over tall buildings against arcing missiles and rapidly firing tanks to reach the Booty and safely carry it away.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX316[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.78975 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.78975 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (FIRE, BOMB)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Super Cobra came out at the same time as "Scramble". While Scramble only went through five areas to the base, Super Cobra went through ten areas. Super Cobra also had more enemies to deal with besides the missiles such as gun batteries and sidewinder missiles. The premise, though, is the same. Penetrate the enemy defenses to make it to the base to pick up the booty. What do you have against all this defense, you have your Super Cobra of course. It will, though, require all of your skills as a pilot to be able to go the distance to get the booty. This game never gained the popularity of Scramble but it still remains a cult classic and actually seems to have had better staying power then Scramble. Perhaps the reason was because it was more of a challenge, who knows.[CR]A Super Cobra unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High'.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]10 points per second of flying.[CR]Missile on ground : 30 points[CR]Sidewinder missile on ground : 40 points[CR]Missile in air : 50 points[CR]Sidewinder missile in air : 60 points[CR]Red UFO : 100 points[CR]UFO : 100 points[CR]Fuel tank : 50 points[CR]Gun battery : 100, 200, or 300 points[CR]Green fireball : 150 points[CR]Missile in ceiling : 30 points[CR]Missile dropping from ceiling : 50 points[CR]Booty : 800 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your helicopter will be at the left side of the screen. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the right side and no slower then the left side. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick back and forth. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control. You will hit a clear area and a message will come up such as '1000 miles cleared', '2000 miles cleared', etc... until your reach the base.[CR]1ST AREA :  This is a basic introductory area. It will allow you to get used to the controls while the threat level remains relatively low. The area is a mix of both mountainous and city.[CR]a) Learn how to vary your speed and you can drop bombs with pinpoint precision. You can only have two bombs on the screen at any one time. You will have to go close to the surface to really make a difference. The biggest threat is the missiles that rise up to meet you.[CR]b) Fuel is a very precious commodity in this game. Don't take a chance trying to bomb a fuel tank. It's better, if you have a flat section, to take out what's under your rocket, and strafe the rest of the way. This way, you ensure you can hit the fuel tank or tanks.[CR]c) Watch the terrain. Sometimes you may be cruising when a mountain will appear suddenly requiring quick reflexes and space you may not have.[CR]d) You also need to watch out for ground fire from the gun batteries. They tend to fire random shots and if you aren't careful, they will hit your helicopter.[CR]2ND AREA : This area introduces you to the sidewinder missile. These missiles are unusual in the fact that they fire at an arc and come back down again. This means your helicopter can get hit two ways. Of course, if it misses your helicopter, it tends to sometimes be helpful by taking out other ground targets such as missiles and gun batteries. The terrain is mountainous.[CR]a) Follow the same pattern as you did in the 1st Area. This time, you need to be wary of the sidewinder missiles.[CR]b) As always, make sure you keep a high fuel level and watch out for those gun batteries.[CR]3RD AREA : You get to deal with the red UFO's in this area. Also, the mountains will get steeper and create ''choke points'' at the top of the screen. Of course, you will have to contend with the UFO's coming through the other side. The terrain is mountainous.[CR]a) The red UFO's aren't too difficult to deal with. They have a tendency to stop in pairs, then come at your helicopter. Again, it's easy to shoot them down.[CR]b) The biggest threats are the 'choke points'. You usually will arrive at the same time as a UFO to see who's first over the mountain. This will require quick reflexes.[CR]c) Even though no missiles come up at you, the gun batteries will still harass you.[CR]4TH AREA : This is a continuation of the 3rd Area. Except this time the area you are flying in is significantly narrowed to a point where it seems like you are going through natural caverns. Use the same methods as the 3rd Area.[CR]5TH AREA : You will have to deal with threats both from above and below in this area. There are missiles in the ceiling of the caverns that will drop down. Although missiles aren't firing from the ground, you still have to deal with gun batteries. The terrain is mountainous and caves.[CR]a) You will have to be real careful in this area, the missiles in the ceiling are pretty concentrated. You will have to be able to speed up and slow down on a dime to avoid them or to shoot them.[CR]b) Don't get too close to the ground since the terrain goes from mountains to canyons very quickly.[CR]c) As already mentioned, get fuel and avoid ground fire.[CR]6TH AREA : The main threat in this area is the fact the gun batteries now move. That's right, they track right along with your helicopter until they hit an obstacle. They travel equally well in the canyons as well as the mountains. This makes them especially dangerous since they are firing at the same time.[CR]a) You will have to accelerate and decelerate frequently to 'fool' the moving gun batteries.[CR]b) When you destroy ground targets, be selective in which ones you hit because if you hit targets in the path of the moving gun batteries, you just allow them to travel farther.[CR]7TH AREA : This area is a little trickier since you now have fireballs coming at your helicopter. In addition, there is a green fireball that likes to track your helicopter and prevent your shots from gaining any distance. It takes seven shots to take out this fireball.  The terrain is mountainous.[CR]a) You will be staying in the valleys most of the time in this area. This is a good time to shoot things up on the ground since again, the missiles won't fly up at your helicopter. Gun batteries, though, will continue to harass you.[CR]b) Timing again is important in this area since there are hills in the valley you must cross over. Of course, the tops of these hills are exposed to the fireballs. Time it so that right after a fireball passes over a hill, accelerate and drop into the next valley. Then decelerate in preparation for the next hill.[CR]8TH AREA : This is repeat of the 3rd area except this time you will be dealing with 'chains' of white UFO's.  Use the same tactics as the 3rd Area.[CR]9TH AREA : This is a very short city area. Just watch out for sidewinder missiles.[CR]10TH AREA : This is the area that will get most players. The movements have to be precise in the caves or you will end up part of the wall.[CR]a) Learn quickly when to accelerate and decelerate within the caves. Right when you come to a ledge, push the joystick all the way back and start lining up for the next cave. Accelerate quickly through it, decelerate and repeat this pattern.[CR]b) Don't worry about running out of fuel in the caves, there are plenty of fuel tanks to top your helicopter off. Plus, you will need all that fuel for not only navigating through the caves, but also the base since it doesn't have any fuel tanks.[CR]BASE : This is the second hardest area that gets a lot of players. You have to be very precise in your movement. You will have to deal with gun batteries firing at you while you are trying to pick up the booty.[CR]a) You will see the KONAMI sign atop one of the buildings. Once you see this, you need to decelerate rapidly and drop down quickly to the shorter building next to the base. Once you almost clear that building, you will have to rapidly decelerate, drop down, grab the booty, and rise quickly to avoid the building on the right.[CR]b) If you fail to grab the booty on a pass, the screen will repeat itself until you either destroy the base or run out of rockets to use on it.[CR]Once you have completed the Base, the action goes back to the 1st Area again. Things, however, will speed up. Fuel consumption is quicker and the enemies also are faster.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Scramble (1981)[CR]2.

				<title_clean>Classics Vert - Scramble</title_clean>
				<plot>Scramble (c) 1981 Konami Industry Company, Limited.[CR]Scramble is a sideways scrolling shoot-em-up in which a single player takes control of a spaceship and must try to fight through six different enemy-packed levels - destroying as many fuel tanks and ground intallations as possible - before reaching the enemy base and destroying it. [CR]Contact with any scenery, ground installations, enemy ships or projectyles results in an instant loss of life. The Scramble ship is armed with both a blaster and bombs. The blaster is forward-firing only while the bombs drop downwards to target ground-based enemy installations and to collect fuel from fuel dumps. [CR]The fuel dumps are of particular importance, as the player ship's fuel gauge constantly depletes as the player progresses through the game and the only way to re-fuel is by bombing the fuel tanks that are located on the ground throughout the levels. Fuel usage increases as the game progresses, until fuel usage actually outstrips the amount of fuel dumps available and the game becomes impossible. [CR]Scramble is rightly considered to be a classic and was the world's first ever 'multi-level' shoot-em-up.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]The Scramble cabinet was the same basic cabinet design that Stern used for all its games. It featured a monitor that was set back at a 45 degree angle, and a very large marquee that was angled towards the player. Most cabinets have straight up and down marquees, so Stern ones are easy to spot. This title features rather primitive painted sideart that only uses two colours, but it makes up for it with the impressive comic-book style art on the control panel and monitor bezel.[CR]The marquee has a roundish 'Scramble' logo, with some sort of space castle in the background. The control panel is aluminium, and it has a mostly yellow design, with game instructions and a red ball-top 8-Way leaf switch joystick mounted centrally. It has fire buttons on both sides of the panel, so it can be played either left handed or right handed. The industry later forgot about lefties altogether and went completely right handed. Most of these machines were uprights, but there were several cocktail units made as well.[CR]Game ID : GX387[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.78975 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.78975 Mhz), (6x) RC (@ 1.78975 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; Laser, Bomb[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Scramble was released in February 1981 in Japan.[CR]Sometimes unfairly referred to as a 'poor man's Defender', Scramble was not only the world's first multi-level shoot-em-up, it was also the first of its type to feature a re-fueling system. These innovations helped to ensure that Scramble was a well deserved commercial success for Konami. [CR]This game was the first title to use the 'Scramble Hardware', which was later used for "Super Cobra", "Lost Tomb", "The End" and a number of other titles. Many of these titles were actually bootlegs of other games, such as Namco's "Pac-Man". This was because Konami neglected to give Scramble ANY copy protection whatsoever; making it incredibly easy to run just about anything that used a Z80 processor, which, at the time, was pretty much every game out there. There were, of course, a lot of Bootleg copies of Scramble itself floating around, such as "Explorer" or "Strafe Bomb".[CR]Scramble is considered the first in the "Gradius" series according to the Nintendo Game Boy Advance "Gradius Galaxies" intro sequence.[CR]This game had a Bulgarian bootleg called "Memory Devices Facility".[CR]A Scramble unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks'.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]10 points per second of flying.[CR]Missile on ground : 50 points[CR]Missile in air : 80 points[CR]UFO : 100 points[CR]Fuel Tank : 150 points[CR]Mystery Base : 100, 200, or 300 points[CR]Main Base : 800 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]A) Always watch what passes below you as you fly, especially in Sectors One through Four.[CR]B) Ignore the 10 points added to your score every second : you want to finish each round quickly, because running out of fuel is bad news.[CR]Try also to hit as many fuel tanks as you can, even in preference to mystery bases. One hundred and fifty points plus fuel is more desirable than an average mystery score of 200 points.[CR]C) When you fuel gets low, the rule is to ignore everything but speed survival, and getting more fuel.[CR]D) In Sector One, fly close to the ground. Your object should be scoring points rather than precise maneuvering, so keep in mind just a few simple rules : [CR]1. Fly slowly only when you must to destroy a rich cluster of targets.[CR]2. Release a couple of bombs just as you top each mountain, then descend quickly into the valley.[CR]3. Once there, shoot any threatening rockets by slowing down for a second and using your laser. Descend to the lowest plateau at the earliest opportunity, shooting lasers constantly to clear your path of targets.[CR]4. Rise with the terrain, using your laser against targets in the foothills, and go all the way up only when the next mountain forces you to.[CR]5. After the last mountain, be prepared for the UFOs.[CR]E) Through Sector Two, simply fly relatively low at medium speed, pressing LASER and BOMB constantly. The laser shots will take care of almost all the UFOs in your way. If one or two survive until you reach them, shift to full speed until you pass them, dodging vertically if necessary.[CR]Try to time the release of your bombs so that they hit fuel tanks, compensating for your middling speed.[CR]F) Don't try to stay alive among the fireballs. Staying below them makes sense for two reasons - you keep your jet, and you even have a chance to pick up some points from the sparse targets below.[CR]As for making if from valley to valley, just go where the fireballs aren't. Fly quickly through each valley, then stop just before you leave shelter. Wait there until a fireball passes just over you; then chances are that you will have a second in which to duck swiftly over and into the next valley. You will find there is definitely a rhythm to it.[CR]G) If you fly through the city too fast, you might not be able to react in time to a juicy cluster of targets or to a rocket rising in your path. Fly at medium speed, lasering and bombing for all you are worth, especially at rockets in front of you and fuel tanks beneath you.[CR]When you fly over silos too deep for your bombs to penetrate, accelerate for a moment in case the rockets suddenly take off toward your underside.[CR]Treat a low roof just as you would a Sector One valley; descend and laser the row of targets into oblivion. Be careful, though, when reascending; the rises here are much more abrupt than Sector One.[CR]H) Without excellent vertical control, you will never make it through Sector Five. Blasting away the fuel tanks blocking your path is vital, but requires much less of your concentration than does piloting the jet through such a tortuous maze.[CR]As soon as you emerge from a passageway, stop. Then move up or down, whichever you need, as far as you can until the screen catches up with you and pushes you forward. Keep the joystick to the left; while the screen propels you, you should have time to find just the right height for entering the next passage.[CR]Once you are in the next passage, speed up right away, giving yourself a head start for the next cavern; you will have to stop once again when you enter it. The cycle requires concentration even once you know the rhythm.[CR]Sometimes, you will enter a cavern at top left and need to leave it through a passage at bottom right, but fuel tanks will block the mouth of the passage, cluttering even the cavern floor. If you are worried about crashing into these tanks from above before you have a chance to laser them, just drop a couple of bombs at the right moment in your descent. The tanks will stand in your way no longer.[CR]I) Once you know its secrets, the base may actually be slightly easier than Sector Five. To destroy the enemy octagon, all you have to do is gun your engine before you enter its canyon, then pull sharply down and back, and nose up to it. If you are on its level, fire your laser; if just above, drop a bomb. You will destroy the base.[CR]You will also crash your own ship, but no matter : you will start the next round with a free replacement. Most players are afraid of crashing, so they fly too high for their bombs to have any hope of reaching the base. Eventually, they crash or run out of fuel.[CR]J) By now, you have probably realized the one step essential to mastering SCRAMBLE; memorization. Since the pattern repeats itself every round, being prepared for upcoming opportunities and dangers is what the game is about.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Scramble (1981)[CR]2.

				<plot>Satan's Hollow (c) 1981 Bally Midway.[CR]Satan's Hollow is a 1- or a 2-player game. When playing this game, the Rocket Launcher is under YOUR control. YOU make it move back and forth across the screen to launch Rockets that will eliminate your attackers. These attackers are displayed in groups, called 'racks', across the top of the screen. The first rack is made up of a small number of attackers. The second rack is made up of a larger number of these attackers. And intermixed with the racks of attackers is a rack with only a single fire-breathing Devil's head. [CR]The attackers and the Devil's Head will try to wipe out your Rocket Launcher. If they do, you lose one player. In emergencies, you have a Shield which goes all around your Rocket Launcher for a short period of time. It is activated by pushing the Shield button on the control console. BUT BE CAREFUL!! This consumes a lot of power and will only last a VERY SHORT TIME! [CR]Each attacker eliminated will cause a Bridge Section to appear at the lower left corner of the screen EXCEPT : when there is already a Bridge Section there or when you have a Bridge Section in tow under your Rocket Launcher. Pick these Sections up with your Rocket Launcher and move them over to build a Bridge across the gorge at the right side of the screen leading into the land of SATAN. [CR]When you complete your Bridge into the land of SATAN, you can cross it and do battle with him. If you win you will be rewarded by increased fire power for your Rocket Launcher. If SATAN defeats you, you lose one player. [CR]As your skill level increases, the number of attackers is increased and the speed that the fire-breathing Devil's Head moves is increased also. [CR]Bonus Rocket Launchers are awarded to you periodically throughout the game as you reach or pass certain preselected point values. Each attacker has an assigned point value. [CR]The object of the game is to HAVE FUN while constantly improving your skills as you play, eliminating as many attackers as possible each time to get the highest score.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Upright model[CR]Game No. 941[CR]This game had a dedicated cabinet that was just plain evil. It is red with realistic demons on both the sideart and the marquee. Flames and a blacklight on the control panel area add to the cool factor. In fact, this machine is up there with "Tron" in the ranking for coolest looking game around. The game was controlled by means of a 2-way trigger stick that was red and sort of translucent. This is the same basic stick that was used for "Tron", it is just colored differently. No one makes this exact stick anymore, but any trigger stick would make a fine replacement.[CR]Bally Midway MCR 2 hardware[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 2.496 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Satan's Hollow was designed and programmed by Arcade Engineering, who designed a slew of games for Midway before being bought out by them in 1985.[CR]Satan's Hollow was released in 1982.

These may have been pre-production titles for the game.[CR]It seems like this game has copied its ideas from many other places.

Remember to watch the timer though![CR]* The lanterns and rings are quite often a deadly diversion as they are sometimes placed in dead end vertical passages. Assess the risks carefully before collecting them.[CR]* Be careful when entering vertical tunnels as you cannot shoot monsters on the other side until they are level with you in a horizontal direction.[CR]* A carefully timed shot can kill a monster in a vertical tunnel, but only when fired exactly when the monster moves into the square in which you are stood.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Programmed by : H.

				<plot>Vanguard (c) 1981 SNK.[CR]Vanguard is a scrolling space shooter (some levels are horizontal, some are diagonal, and some are vertical). Shoot down enemies with your laser. Keep a close eye on your ever decreasing fuel gauge, luckily each enemy that you destroy will add to your remaining fuel. Find the energy pods to be temporarily invulnerable; the energy pods will also increase your fuel level. At the end of each level you must defeat a boss that is guarded by two moving force fields with holes in them. The computer will announce the name of the each zone using some nifty early 80's synthesized speech. The different levels include Mountain Zone, Rainbow Zone, Styx Zone, Rainbow Zone 2, Stripe Zone, Rainbow Zone 3, Bleak Zone, and the City of Mystery.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 930 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : Custom (@ 930 Khz), (2x) SN76477 (@ 930 Khz)[CR]Screen orientation : Vertical[CR]Video resolution : 224 x 256 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 61.25 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 64[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 4[CR]= &gt; [1] Fire Left, [2] Fire Right, [3] Fire Down, [4] Fire Up[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Vanguard was released in July 1981 in Japan and put SNK on the map in North America.[CR]Vanguard is the first color game from SNK and it was one of the first shoot-em-ups with an 8-way directional fire.[CR]The starting music is inspired by the 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' soundtrack (release date is 1979), and later became the theme song to the 1987-1994 television series 'Star Trek: The Next Generation'. [CR]The music that plays when you get the power-up is 'Vultan's Theme: Attack of the Hawk Men' from the 'Flash Gordon' soundtrack.[CR]A Vanguard unit appears in the 1982 movie 'Jekyll &amp; Hyde...

Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the right side and no slower then the left side. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick back and forth. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control. Here are some strategies for getting through them. There is no break between the areas, but you can pretty much tell what area you are in by the landscape and/or the enemies.[CR]MOUNTAIN ZONE : This zone is pretty straightforward. The mountain is wide enough for you to maneuver out of harms way.[CR]1) There should be no reason that you can't go through both areas energized. The energy stations are abundant in the mountain zone.[CR]2) The Harley's like to group up in packs of five or six. They will fire on you and an occasional Harley will break from the pack to try to ram your fighter. They usually stay on one level and don't move around a lot. Very easy to evade.[CR]3) The Mist's are a different matter. They move around all over the area and they are rather difficult to hit. You will have to use your lasers from different sides very effectively.[CR]RAINBOW ZONE : In these zones you will be going diagonal up or diagonal down. The first part only has three aliens while the second part of the zone has six aliens moving up and down.[CR]1) On the diagonal up parts, get your fighter in between the second and third aliens during the first part. Reverse this on the diagonal down parts.[CR]2) On the second part, you will have to get in between the fourth and fifth aliens. You may have to use your top laser to clear out the alien above since the top three alternate with the bottom three. Reverse this on the diagonal down parts.[CR]STYX ZONE : There are no energy stations in this zone so you will have to do some quick maneuvering and firing in all directions. This area also narrow significantly. Use the same tactics from the Mountain Zone.[CR]STRIPE ZONE :  You only have to deal with ground targets in this zone. This, though, is the problem since those targets are clustered very close together.[CR]1) You should be able to go through this area energized since energy stations are abundant in the lower parts of this zone.[CR]2) If you aren't energized, make sure you decided quickly to go high or low. If you go high, you deal with bases and Garines (bouncing aliens). This can be rough if you mistime it. The bottom has more targets but you must destroy the barrier. You do this by destroying the upper or lower stand that fires it up.[CR]3) This zone lasts a while but the pattern remains the same.[CR]BLEAK ZONE : You will be going up instead of sideways. The scrolling now is you can't go faster then the top of the screen or slower then the bottom of the screen.[CR]1) Enemies on this screen are actually pretty easy to get through. Just stay in the middle and keep firing. The Romeda may give you trouble since they like to fire left diagonal shots.[CR]2) If you go into the debris left from the Kemlus, a backward 'C' will surround your fighter and you will get 1090 points. You can do this three times. After the third time, if you try this, your fighter will be destroyed.[CR]CITY OF MYSTERY : This is for all the marbles. There are many hazards to avoid as you try to take out Gond.[CR]1) First, as you enter there are lasers to your left and right. You must quickly get into the second part. Gond is protected by two layers that have openings. These openings line up for only brief moments. Try to take shots through this opening.[CR]2) After a short amount of time, walls will close behind your fighter. You only have a limited amount of time because there are five walls and if they close before you take out Gond, you lose your fighter.[CR]3) The only good thing is if you fail to take out Gond, you advance to the next round. Of course, you don't get the bonus for Gond.[CR]4) After you make it through each set of cave one and cave two, the action gets faster.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Vanguard (1981)[CR]2.

				<plot>Zaxxon (c) 1982 Sega.[CR]Zaxxon is an isometric scrolling shoot-em-up in which the player pilots an armed spaceship and must penetrate heavily-fortified enemy bases, destroying enemy ships and installations before reaching the final confrontation with a giant armoured robot. [CR]The game consists of three different waves: [CR]* Floating Fortress: Players must penetrate the fortress's defences, destroying fuel tanks, gun emplacements, missiles and fighters. An altimeter constantly monitors the player ship's height, necessary to navigate through the walls and electronic barriers that form part of fortress's defences. The player's ship carries a limited amount of fuel that is constantly depleting and can only be replenished by shooting ground-based enemy fuel tanks. If the ship's fuel runs out, it crashes to the ground and a life is lost.[CR]* Fighter Fleet: This takes place in outer-space with the player attacked by waves of enemy fighters and rogue satellites. The player ship's fuel does not deplete during this wave.[CR]* Enemy Headquarters: This is similar to the 'Floating Fortress' wave (with fuel depletion once again being an issue), but with the player facing much tougher defences. Upon completion of this wave, the player enters into battle with a giant armoured robot. The robot fires fast-moving homing missiles and needs to be hit six times before it's destroyed. Upon completion of the third wave, the game starts over with a higher level of difficulty.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]BOARD # 834-0211[CR]There were 2 different dedicated cabinets available for Zaxxon, an upright and a cocktail :[CR]* The upright version came in a nice woodgrain cabinet with black and blue sticker style sideart. The marquee is a blue 'Zaxxon' logo with a star filled background. The control panel has a nice 8-Way flight stick with fire buttons on either side, and graphics explaining how to play the game. Finally the upright uses two sets of coin mechs that are of an odd 'skinny' style.[CR]* The cocktail version came in the standard Sega/Gremlin cocktail table (this same table was also used for "Frogger", "Carnival", and several other titles). This was a relatively unadorned machine, the only decorations were a set of instruction cards underneath the glass. This machine had a control panel on either side and used Wico balltop joysticks instead of flight sticks.[CR]All versions used a vertical open frame monitor, and ran the same set of game boards. This game is fully compatible with "Congo Bongo", "Super Zaxxon", and "Future Spy" (those boards will plug right in without modification).[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.04125 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Discrete circuitry[CR]Screen orientation : Vertical[CR]Video resolution : 224 x 256 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 59.999408 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 256[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released during January 1982. At the time of its release, Zaxxon was unique as it was the first game to employ isometric projection, something of a three-quarters viewing perspective. This effect simulated three dimensions (albeit from the viewpoint of a second person).[CR]In the game, Zaxxon is the name of the enemy robot who you must destroy. Milton Bradley turned this and other Sega titles into board games. 'Can You Complete Your Mission Before Zaxxon Zaps You?'.[CR]Vernon Kalanikaus holds the official official record for this game with 4,680,740 points on March 15, 1982.[CR]A Zaxxon unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames'.[CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Jackson".[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Zaxxon was released in at least 2 versions :[CR]The latest version (set 1 in MAME (zaxxon)) corrects a minor error in the way the original zaxxon rom set (set 2 in MAME (zaxxon2)) managed fractions of a credit, seen only when a player earned credit through game play when the game dipswitch settings provided only a fraction of a full credit for each token inserted.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Gun Implacements (Green and Gray) : 200 or 500 points (random)[CR]Fuel Tank : 300 points[CR]Radar Tower : 1,000 points[CR]Missile (Ground-to-Air) : 150 points[CR]Missile (Air-to-Air) : 200 points[CR]Fighters (on runway) : 50 points[CR]Fighters (in air) : 100 points + (50 points/level after level 2)[CR]Zaxxon (destroyed with missile in launcher) : 1,000 points[CR]Zaxxon (destroying launched missile) : 200 points[CR]Destroying all planes in space : 1,000 points[CR]Satellite : 300 points[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* To kill Zaxxon, fly at 2 1/2 units (in other words, with two blocks of your altimeter filled in and one at halfway). Shoot 6 shots at Zaxxon's missile, and you will kill it quickly. If you miss, either dodge the missile, or keep firing and you can still blow up the missile. However, you get less points for hitting the missile while it's in the air.[CR]* Flying at an altitude of 1 1/2 will allow you to hit ground targets while making their shots go harmlessly under you.[CR]* Shoot airplanes on the platform : it will reduce the number you need to kill in the space scene. If you shoot all the airplanes in space you will get a bonus.[CR]* On the levels in outer space, start up the highest point on the upper left and start shooting immediately. You should be able to hit the satellite right away. If you miss, keep moving to the left and keep firing. This works for the second satellite also.[CR]* This is important in later levels because it is possible to run out of fuel in space : if you hit the satellite, you will get some back.[CR]* There are only two levels that repeat. The first air fortress level never gets much harder : use the same pattern for it. On the other levels, only the gaps become narrower.[CR]* Always keep firing! This way you can see if you will make it through the gaps, and you can adjust your height as needed.[CR]* The white canopy only indicates that the enemy plane is at the highest altitude. At any altitude, when an enemy is in your line of fire you will hear a tone and a white X appears in front of your plane. This makes it much easier to grab the 1,000 point bonus for destroying 20 enemy planes, as well as to avoid their shots.[CR]* On later levels you will lose fuel quickly. Make sure you hit as many fuel tanks as possible. If you run out of fuel you will lose a ship.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Zaxxon (1982, Arcade)[CR]2. Super Zaxxon (1982, Arcade)[CR]3.

Your ship appears to be flying above the surface of the planet and actually flies over walls and other VFD generated images (not possible with just one VFD display). The planet's surface and ground based enemies are created by one VFD, while you and air-based enemies are created by the VFD reflected off a mirror. [CR]LCD handheld game [US] (1982) released by Bandai : it's a cool double panel LCD game (there are two LCD panels on top of each other). The dual panel creates a kind of 3D effect with lower objects on one panel, and higher ones on the other. Also, all of the background images are created by the LCD and animated. It's quite impressive for an LCD game (and a must have if you love Zaxxon!). [CR]VFD handheld game [US] (19??) released by Bandai : this game has a unique way of creating a 3-D effect - it only uses 1 VFD display (unlike Coleco's Zaxxon which uses two). The VFD is basically split in two, the upper half you see as the lower part of the playing field, while the lower part of the VFD is reflected on a semi-transparent mirror to create the upper half of the 3-D playing space.. Pretty cool idea to help, and it really works in that all of the ships (not just the players ship like on the Coleco version) have a true depth. It's a little awkward to play sometimes as you have to sit just right to get all of the screen centered perfectly, but once you are in position, it's a very nice version of Zaxxon. It features the planes in space mode, and the flying over land mode.. The only thing that seems to be missing is the actual Zaxxon boss at the end...[CR]BlackBerry [US] (December 21, 2009) "Zaxxon [Model 5341]"[CR]</plot>

				<plot>BlaZeon (c) 1992 Atlus Company, Limited.[CR]The player is set in control of The Garland TFF-01, a sub-standard space fighter ship that is only armed with a semi-auto or rapid fire laser gun known as the Beam Vulcan and the Tranquilander. Some enemy units can be captured and used in play; certain enemy robots, when shot by the player's Tranquilander, will morph into an outline of themselves. The player can then fly into the outline, and take on the form of the enemy robot, taking control of its weapons, abilities and special attacks.[CR]There is also addition to the boss battle scoring: similar to some shooters, players have the opportunity to increase their scores by beating the end level bosses within a certain time limit. Every time a boss battle is initiated, a timer will count down and once the boss is destroyed/killed before the timer reaches zero, then the time left will add to the player's end-level score; if the timer runs out, then the score at the end of the level will remain unaffected.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID: ATL-67140[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz), Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Star programmer : Hiroyuki Arai (Dandy Arai)[CR]Sound : Tsukasa Masuko (Macco)[CR]Japanese planners : Ethiopian Taro, Toshiya Matsuyama, BIRD[CR]Object engineers : Shinji Tago, Hikaru Takeyasu, Masahiro Kuroda[CR]Screen designers : Shinji Tago, Hakase100%, Magnam.K[CR]Opening animators : Kenji Teraoka, Yasuhito Kikuchi, Motoaki Satoh, Naoki Kobayashi, Yusuke Satoh, Kazuyo Nakamura[CR]Opening CG : Youtai Isseki, Hikaru Takeyasu, Sin[CR]Opening makers : T.

				<plot>Boogie Wings (c) 1992 Data East Corp.[CR]A superbly playable, humourous and utterly unique shoot-em-up from the Date East stable. The player begins each life in control of a bi-plane with a huge metal hook attached to its rear. This hook can be used to pick up enemies, objects, bombs and vehicles which can then be thrown both at other enemies, and at any walls and doorways that may be barring the player's route.[CR]If the bi-plane takes two hits from enemy forces, it will explode and the player is forced to continue on foot. The on-foot sections play in a vaguely similar fashion to SNK's legendary "Metal Slug" series, but while on foot, the player has no protection from enemy hits and is very vulnerable to attack. As such, a replacement vehicle (which appear in the form of tanks, motorbikes, giant robots, elephants etc.) must be found quickly.[CR]Boogie Wings features highly detailed and completely destructible scenery, with a multitude of background animations making the game feel 'alive' and giving it much of its distinctive character. The game's settings are as original as its gameplay; with museums, fairgrounds, the inside of skyscrapers etc. all making an appearance. Boogie Wings soundtrack is also unique to the genre, with a mixture of well-known jazz and blues tunes accompanying the frenetic on-screen action.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]PCB # : DE-0379-1[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 14 Mhz)[CR]Sound : Hudson Soft HuC6280A, YM2151, YM3012, (2x) OKI6295[CR]RAM: (2x) 62256, (5x) 6264[CR]Dipswitch : (2x) 8 position[CR]Players : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in December 1992 in US.[CR]This game is also known as "The Great Ragtime Show".[CR]The 'Blues Brothers' appear in the 'Merry Merry Christmas' stage.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Secret Character 'Santa Claus' : on the 'Merry Merry Christmas' stage, pick up the stage boss's head parts with the skyhook and throw it after you have destroyed the boss.

				<plot>Bosconian - Star Destroyer (c) 1981 Namco. [CR]Bosconian is a multi-directional space shooter where the player must destroy several enemy bases on each round while evading enemy ships, asteroids and mines. Enemy bases are destroyed either with a shot to the center or by shooting out all six base cannons. The player's ship is always positioned in the center of the screen with everything else scrolling around it as the player flies. A radar map to the right shows the position of the player, enemy bases, and occasional formation attack groups.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model] [CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (x3), MB88xx [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG, custom DAC (for speech), discrete circuitry (for the shot and explosions sounds)[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Bosconian was released in November 1981 in Japan.[CR]The subtitle 'Star Destroyer' appears exclusively on the game's title screen.[CR]Bosconian was famous for being the first game to have a continue feature. [CR]The 'Spy Ship' in this game also makes a cameo appearance in "Galaga" as one of the three "transform" ships. [CR]In the game "Ridge Racer", a car has this game as a sponsor. It is a white and red car named 'RT Bosconian'. Its sister car, from another Namco game is a white and blue car named 'RT Nebulasray'. They were used in "Ridge Racer", "Ridge Racer 2", "Ridge Racer 64", and "Ridge Racer DS". [CR]The origin of the keywords in Bosconian (as in the 'Zwilniks of Boskone') is the Lensman space-opera saga, which in Japan always enjoyed high popularity.

Both versions have the same Enemy Base setups, but they are in different order as the rounds go up. This is also true regarding where your fighter starts at. For example, the setup for Round 4 on the other versions is the same as the setup for Round 6 on the new Namco version.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Asteroid : 10 points[CR]Cosmo Mine : 20 points[CR]I-Type Missile (Looks like fighter) : 50 points[CR]P-Type Missile (Looks like boomerang) : 60 points[CR]E-Type Missile (Looks like Enemy Base Missile) : 70 points[CR]Spy Ship : 200 or 400 points[CR]Enemy Station Cannon : 200 points[CR]Enemy Station : 1,500 points[CR]Enemy Formation : 500, 1,000 or 1,500 points depending on missile type[CR]Control Fighter in Formation (The off-colored fighter) : 100, 120 or 140 points (twice the normal missile value)[CR]Bonus for no-miss clear (completing a round without dying) - this bonus is given only when the game is set to auto difficulty : multiplier x number of bases, the multiplier starts at 100 points and increases by 100 points each time you get the bonus up to 1,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Easter Egg :[CR]1) Enter service mode.[CR]2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Up(x5), Right(x6), Down, Left(x4). '(c) 1981 NAMCO LTD.' will be added at the bottom of the screen.[CR]* The action starts immediately as soon as you start your game (the synthesized voice will state "Blast Off!" at the start of each new stage and each new life). Your fighter will be put on the screen. Your radar display will show how many space stations need to be taken out. The radar doesn't show, though, all the space debris all over the place and the enemy fighters (unless they are in formation). Your fighter stays in the middle of the screen.[CR]* Be aware that the enemy missiles are faster then your ship. This means you will have to learn to use the joystick proficiently so that you can maneuver away from these enemy missiles attempting to commit suicide on your ship.[CR]* At the beginning of the round, quickly look at your radar to determine where the Enemy Stations are. Then quickly figure out a systematic way of destroying them since time is one's enemy in this game. Just because they are lined up in a row doesn't mean that the missile bays are facing the same direction.[CR]* By that same token, your ship fires lasers from both the front and back. This means if anything is trying to 'sneak' up on you, they won't stand a chance.[CR]* Use the space debris to your advantage. You score points regardless of whether you hit the enemy, or if you use other means to assist, such as the mines or rocks.  Just keep in mind that the space debris doesn't return until the next round.[CR]* The Enemy Stations can be destroyed two ways :[CR]1) The first way is to fire a shot directly into their missile bay. This is easy to do on the first two rounds.  By round three, the missile bay has a door which opens and closes to make it more of a challenge. After round three, the station will fire a missile if your fighter is in the missiles path. You can easily destroy this missile with your ship.[CR]2) The other way is to destroy all six cannons around the space station. This method also enables you to get more points in the long run. To do this, though, means you will have to deal with more enemy missiles since you have to constantly loop around to hit the cannons. In addition, the pods fire back on your ship.[CR]* Enemy Stations can be oriented with the missile bay facing left/right or up/down. Keep this in mind if you are taking on multiple stations in one area. While you are pounding on one Enemy Station, three more may be firing at your ship to prevent you from destroying your target.[CR]* The warning conditions tell you how safe it is for the moment :[CR]1) GREEN means no enemies within view.[CR]2) YELLOW means enemies present.[CR]3) RED means that either you have taken too long or you failed to destroy the Spy Ship while it was within range, and the enemy is now moving twice as fast to ram you. [CR]* You will also hear synthesized voice prompts stating "Blast Off!" at the start of each new round, "Alarm! Alarm!" when enemies attack, "Battle Stations!" when an enemy formation approaches, "Spy Ship Sighted!" when the Spy Ship appears, and "Condition Red!" when you enter the red condition.[CR]* At regular intervals, a formation of enemy missiles will head toward your ship. You can see what the formation of these enemy missiles are in by looking at the area above the top, left corner of the radar. This will show you if they are in a line, checkerboard pattern, etc. You will also see this formation (represented by a red dot) on your radar screen. Some quick tips for tangling with formations :[CR]1) Enemy formations always appear as a control missile with four missiles.[CR]2) If you destroy the control missile, the other missiles will spread out. You can still destroy them but it is much harder to get the points for taking out the entire formation.[CR]3) Try to maneuver in such a way as to be able to rapidly hit all the missiles. This is of course barring the fact there is no other things (rocks and mines) in the way that can destroy these missiles. This works well when they are in a line. If they are in a checkerboard pattern, you will have to move back and forth so you can hit everything but the control missile.[CR]4) A synthesized voice stating 'Battle Stations' will announce when a formation is present.[CR]* As mentioned before, if you take too long to take out the Enemy Stations, the condition will go to RED and enemy missiles will pour into the area with the only intent of ramming your ship.  You will know this also by the sound the machine makes. [CR]* Continue to fly erratic patterns (unless you are going after Enemy Stations or formations) because the enemy missiles do move quicker then you do plus you will probably be able to take them out more effectively.[CR]* Just as in "Time Pilot", there is a way you can stay on a level for as long as you want (This works best on level 2) : Stay away from all the bases, and fly horizontally from left to right. Just fire continuously at all the formations that come at you. The other ships will never be able to come after you. There is no time limit in the game, and it never gets any harder. You can stay on this level for as long as you want. It takes a VERY LONG TIME, though, to get a LARGE score.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Bosconian (1981)[CR]2.

				<plot>Choplifter (c) 1985 Sega.[CR]The player assumes the role of a combat helicopter pilot. The player attempts to save hostages being held in prisoner of war camps in an unnamed enemy country. The player must collect the P.O.W.s, transport them safely to the nearby friendly base, all the while fighting off hostile tanks and other enemy combatants. There are a total of 32 hostages per level. To rescue more than 20 will advance the player to the next level.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 834-5795[CR]Runs on the Sega "System 1" hardware.[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Choplifter was released in October 1985 in Japan.[CR]This game is a port from an original programmed by Dan Gorlin in 1982 for the Apple II. Choplifter was one of the few games to take the reverse route : first appearing on a home system and being ported to the arcade.[CR]Charles Collins holds the official record for this game with 1,781,000 points on June 27, 1986.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* In the early stages, try to fly as low as possible - this way the fighters will not shoot you, and you are low enough to shoot the ground targets without being shot. Since this only works when you're in the air, and not when you're on the ground, it only works well on levels 1 and 3.[CR]* To ensure that the tank won't arrive when you're picking up hostages, barely tap the joystick up between each hostage. This will cause the helicopter to lift off a little and reset the timer that causes the tanks to arrive.[CR]* On level 2, you can land on the water under the boat when dropping off your men and they will climb up the side of the boat. This stops the planes from coming down and shooting you.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Choplifter (1982, Apple II)[CR]2. Choplifter II (1991, Nintendo Game Boy)[CR]3.

				<plot>Darius (c) 1986 Taito Corp.[CR]A horizontally scrolling shoot-em-up that was unique at the time for featuring a game screen that was three times wider than the conventional size, with the arcade cabinet utilizing three CRT screens to accommodate it.[CR]In the game, the player flies an ornate fighter craft called a Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two attack weapons : Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the 'Arm' (armor); a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship.[CR]During the course of the levels the player must navigate the terrain and battle a variety of fighter craft, ground vehicles, turrets, and other obstacles. At the end of every level, players are greeted with the obligatory end-of-level boss. The bosses in Darius are often in the form of mechanical aquatic animals, such as fish or squid. If the player defeats the boss, the tunnel splits into two and the player must decide whether to take the upper or lower tunnel, both of which lead to a different stage. This allows many different paths to be taken through the game.[CR]Power-ups can be obtained by shooting enemies of a certain color, with the power-ups appearing in the form of colored bubbles. Each color corresponds to one of the ship's three weapons :[CR]* Red - Missile[CR]* Green - Bomb[CR]* Blue - Arm[CR]If the player powers up a weapon more than seven times, the weapon changes to a new, more powerful version. This then becomes the player's default weapon, and can be powered up further.

The Silver Hawks are a trademark of the series.[CR]Another trademark of the series is the unique branching level structure. The levels are arranged in a large binary tree, and at the end of each level, the player must choose one of two paths to follow. This means that there are many different paths that can be taken through the game.[CR]The heroes' names in Darius series 'PROCO' and 'TIAT' backwards spell 'TAITO CORP'.[CR]The first stage music is a remix of the "Metal Soldier Isaac II" intro music (1985).[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Darius - PCCB-00093) on August 21, 1992.[CR]Zuntata Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Zuntata History L'ab-normal 1st - ZTTL-0038) on April 1, 1999.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Progression of the bubbles :[CR]Weapons (red) : Bullets --&gt; Lasers --&gt; Wave[CR]Shields (blue) : Green --&gt; Silver --&gt; Gold[CR]Bombs (green) : Single --&gt; Dual --&gt; Quad[CR]* Miscellaneous bubbles :[CR]Points (grey): Points[CR]Extra-ship : Bomb certain key spots on the terrain.[CR]* Power levels : There are eight power levels (0-7) within each armament category.

				<plot>Darius II (c) 1989 Taito.[CR]The direct sequel to the 1986 original, Darius II retained the distinctive 3-screen format of the first game.[CR]The power-up system of Darius II was changed from that of its parent game, with players having to destroy complete waves of a particular enemy to earn a power-up. 2 new power-ups were also added; the 1st was a new weapon power-up that gave the player green, vertical lasers, the 2nd power-up was a rainbow-colored item that powered up all of the players weapons.[CR]Another new feature of Darius II is the appearance of mini-bosses - large enemies that appear at the mid point of a level, possessing similar strength and abilities to those of the game's normal bosses (such as extravagant weapons, or the inability to be damaged without first exposing a vulnerable area). The mini-bosses in Darius II are in fact smaller versions of the bosses from Darius.[CR]The game is set in the inner regions of the Solar system, and has the same branching level structure as Darius, allowing players to select their own route through the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Prom Stickers : C07[CR]Main CPU : (2x) Motorola 68000[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610, (4x) Volume[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Darius II was released in September 1989.[CR]This game is known in US as "Sagaia" (licensed to Romstar for distribution).[CR]Two versions of this game were made : The more common three-screen version (like the original "Darius"), and a harder to find two-screen version (aspect ratio : 8/3)[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Darius II : G.S.M.

				<plot>Darius Gaiden - Silver Hawk (c) 1994 Taito Corporation.[CR]In the game, the third in the sequel of Darius series; the player flies an ornate fighter craft called a Silver Hawk. The craft is equipped with two attack weapons: Missile (forward-firing standard gun) and Bomb (drops from the bottom of the ship). The Silver Hawk is also equipped with the 'Arm' (armor); a green energy shield that can absorb enemy attacks without harm to the ship. Some enemies leave panels behind that can be collected to power-up your shots, missiles or shield.[CR]The graphics and sound are superior to those of the previous Darius games, and the game employs a lot of impressive visual effects; for example, the Silver Hawk warps into a stage dramatically in the fourth-tier stages, and begins to burn on re-entry at the start of the sixth-tier stages.[CR]The bosses are huge and far more complex than those of the previous games, each employing several attack patterns and explode with powerful warping and twisting effects upon their defeat.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "Taito F3 System" Hardware.[CR]Prom Stickers: D87[CR]Screen Orientation: Horizontal[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR]=&gt; Missile, Bomb[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Darius Gaiden was released on September 19, 1994. [CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Darius Side Story - Silver Hawk'. [CR]The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'AAA'. [CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Darius Gaiden - PCCB-00166) on November 18, 1994.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version has the "Recycle It, Don't Trash It!" screen. [CR]There was an EXTRA version (on March 6, 1995) in this game and it was their official hack with increased rapid fire, and swapped bosses. In this EXTRA version, in a 1-player game, if you press 2P Start, you won't be able to select your path at the end of a level, and you'll have to complete the 28 levels to end the game. The same "trick" is available in a 2-player game if you press 2P Start first, then let Player 1 join in.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Items list:[CR]- Red Shield: Appears when a red enemy is destroyed.

				<title_clean>Shmups Horiz - Dragon Breed</title_clean>
				<plot>Dragon Breed (c) 1989 Irem Corp.[CR]Dragon Breed is a superb and innovative side-scrolling shoot-em-up from the same gaming stable that gave the world "R*Type", Irem. Dragon Breed differs from other shoot-em-ups through its interpretation of the 'ship' that appears in other games of the genre; in Dragon Breed, the player controls a figure who rides a fully articulated and superbly rendered dragon. What makes this a particularly inspired move is that the Dragon's body - which is invulnerable to enemies and enemy fire - can be used as both a shield and a weapon; the player can move the dragon in such a way that its tail can be used to surround its rider and protect him from his enemies. Any contact the enemy has with the dragon will also deplete the enemy's power and eventually kill it. The dragon can also be 'powered-up' in a similar fashion to the space craft of other shoot-em-ups.[CR]At various point throughout a level, small areas of land will appear at the bottom of the screen. These often contain power-ups and the player can fly the dragon down to the platform, dismount, and move around on foot.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]This game was only sold as a conversion kit, although many distributors would pre-install these kits in generic cabinets, and sell them to the public that way. This is a JAMMA compatible title, so any JAMMA cabinet could be a proper Dragon Breed cabinet. The control panel to this title has a single 8-Way joystick, with fire and jump buttons on either side of it (so you can play either left or right handed). The marquee for this title is a highly detailed scene of a knight riding a green dragon, while being attacked by what appears to be a group of carnivorous fish. Although you may encounter this title in a cocktail cabinet (as the circuit board supports the screen flip for the second player), there were no specific graphics made for a cocktail cabinet (So the game will appear either unmarked, or perhaps with a few of the graphics from the upright kit jury rigged into place).[CR]Irem M-81 system hardware[CR]Main CPU : V30 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), DAC (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 384 x 256 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 55.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 512[CR]Players : 1[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Dragon Breed was released in June 1989.[CR]The game borrows quite a few game design elements from Irem's "R-type" classic shooter series![CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Dragon Breed - PCCB-00006) on October 21, 1989.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Secret Invincibility :[CR]1) Turn DIP 2-7 ON.[CR]2) Reset the game with holding Player 1-Button 2.[CR]3) You will be able to start a game with invincibility.[CR]* Dragon Breed power-ups :[CR]Red : the dragon breathes a flame.

				<plot>G-Darius (c) 1997 Taito Corp.[CR]G-Darius literally added a new dimension to the highly regarded 'Darius' series, with the introduction of fully 3D rendered backgrounds and enemies. Namco had already done the same with their Xevious series for "Xevious 3D/G", released two years' earlier, but G-Darius is generally regarded as the most accomplished of the two titles.[CR]G-Darius' game-play was also enhanced, with the 'Capture Ball' system; this allowed the player to capture almost any enemy craft and use it against the game's other enemies. Captured enemies can either be detonated like a ''bomb'', damaging all enemies nearby; or used to fire a special 'Alpha Beam', which cuts through everything but gold-colored objects and enemy bosses. Each boss is capable of firing its own version of this beam at the player; when both beams meet, they will interrupt each other's path. Depending on how rapidly the player presses the Fire button, one beam will grow and eventually overpower the others. The Capture ball was actually introduced in "Darius Gaiden" but was only used to a minimal extent.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Taito FX-1B hardware[CR]Prom Stickers : E39[CR]Main CPU : PSX (@ 16.9344 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : SPU (@ 16.9344 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]G-Darius was released in September 1995.[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Reverse Scale Bullet' and is an example of 'ateji' - fitting the kanji phonetics to the name of the game to give the name double (sometimes even triple) meaning.[CR]The game was originally named 'Fire Breaker' at early stage of development.[CR]Lee Ota (from the Truxton series staff) produced this game. It's why the first and the last stage (and bomb/power-up) are similar to "Truxton". But the gameplay is really different to Toaplan's games. So, responses from Toaplan games fans were not very favourable.[CR]The name of the twin characters, Orsa and Mayoru, is a play-on-words of the third largest constellation of our solar system, Ursa Major, which  means Great Bear.[CR]All stages in this game share the same music theme but remixed each time![CR]The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'AAA'.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Welcome to the Karu Land - PCCB-00196) on November 17, 1995.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Zone Select :[CR]1.

				<title_clean>Shmups Horiz - Galaxy Force 2</title_clean>
				<plot>Galaxy Force II (c) 1988 Sega Enterprises, Limited.[CR]A superb sprite-scaling shoot-em-up from Sega, in which a single player must battle their way through a number of superbly rendered, space-themed levels. Action switches between open space battles and planet-based levels; with tight, enemy packed tunnel sections (enemy bases) seperating each level.[CR]Galaxy Force II took the space-based shooting action of 1985's "Space Harrier" and, to a lesser degree, "After Burner" and improved upon both in every conceivable way. The game's pace is much slower paced than either "Space Harrier" or "After Burner", making game progression more a result of actual skill than the blind luck often associated with those earlier titles.[CR]Elements of Galaxy Force II were also influenced by several NON-shooting Sega games; in particular the branching roads of 1986's "Out Run". At the end of each of Galaxy Force II's stages, after the player has fought through the end-of-level 'enemy fortress'; are tunnel sections offering a choice of left or right. Again, the choice made dictates which level the player tackles next.[CR]Galaxy Force II also demonstrated just how far Sega could push its then legendary sprite scaling technonolgy, with the visual rendition of some levels - such as when the player is flying above the surface of a volcanic planet, complete with solar flares and volcanic eruptions - being nothing short of spectacular.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Deluxe model][CR]Sega Y Board hardware[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 1988 in Japan.[CR]Also released a Galaxy Force II [Super Deluxe model][CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (G.S.M.

				<plot>Gradius (c) 1985 Konami.[CR]A superb and demanding shoot'em up that shares - along with Irem's "R*Type" - the distinction of being a true innovator of its genre and, again like R*Type, completely revolutionized the humble shoot-em-up.[CR]Gradius' eye-catching graphics guaranteed gamer interest but it was the game's genius 'weapon upgrade' system that really made the difference. Never before could players actually CHOSE how to upgrade their ship. Destroying waves of enemies would often see the player reward with an 'orb' that could be picked up. The player could collect up to 6 orbs and could effectively 'buy' an upgrade from the 6 displayed at the bottom of the play area (speed-up, bombs, double, laser, multiple - which are orbs that follow the player's movements and add greater firepower - and a mystery 6th upgrade that is marked with an '?'). Game difficulty increases depending on how many power-ups the player has, so it is sometimes advantageous to NOT power-up your ship too much.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Konami Bubble System.[CR]Game ID : GX400[CR]Main CPU : MC 68000 @ 10Mhz / G400 BIOS[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80[CR]Sound chip : 2 x AY-3-8910 psg [CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Gradius was released in May 1985.[CR]This game is known in Europe as "Nemesis".[CR]First shoot-em-up with serious power-ups.[CR]Designers did a lot of tries before they fixed the design of the ship. They did at least 100 different versions. And among all of them, there was a ship that leaved a light trace behind him when he moves. It was from an evolution of this concept that was born the 'Options system'.[CR]Soundtrack releases:[CR][JP] [Cassette] (Nov.21, 1987) Original Sound of Gradius &amp; Salamander [Battle Music Collection][CR][JP] [Audio CD] (Nov.21, 1987) Original Sound of Gradius &amp; Salamander [Battle Music Collection][CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-85) on June 27, 1986.[CR]Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Original Sound of Gradius - KHY1016) in cassette format on May 5, 1987. Also released the soundtrack album in CD format (Original Sound of Gradius - BY12-5021) on November 21, 1988.[CR]Interesting note : Several Konami arcade games ("Gradius", "Parodius Da! - Shinwa kara Owarai e", "Salamander", etc...) have the default high score set at 57300. '573' refers to Go-Na-Mi kana letters, a play of word for 'Konami'.[CR]Bandai released a board game (in Japan only) based on this video game (same name) in 1986 : The board is split into 8 sections, each with its own rules. The things that remain the same are that each uses a square-grid for movement, and you can power up your ship by getting the capsules.[CR]The first level of Gradius is available as a mini-game in the Nintendo Super NES game "Legend of the Mystical Ninja". [CR]In the Nintendo NES hockey game Blades of Steel, one of the intermission screens is a playable sequence which recreates the fight against the first Gradius boss.[CR]The popular trading card game 'Yu-Gi-Oh!' has drawn inspiration for some of its cards from the game, which are Gradius, Cyclon Laser, Gradius' Option, Victory Viper XX03, and Power Capsule. Other cards include enemies and boss characters such as Solar Flare Dragon,The Statue of Easter Island, Moai Interceptor Cannons, B.E.S. Covered Core, Big Core, B.E.S. Tetran, and B.E.S. Crystal Core, as well as the spell card Boss Rush.[CR]Konami's music simulation game "Pop'n Music" features the song 'Gradius Full-Speed' which is a mix of the music in the first level of Gradius. This song is also featured in "beatmania IIDX".[CR]There's an unlockable 3-D remake of the original Gradius arcade game found in "Zone of the Enders - The 2nd Runner". It's called Zoradius (for Zone + Gradius). It can be found in the battle against Vic Viper, or by replaying the fight as an Extra mission, then pausing the game an entering a variation of the Konami Code. In Zoradius, the player uses the Vic Viper in fighter mode, flying through a tunnel and shooting down various non-humanoid enemies from the game to gather powerups to increase the Viper's firepower and shields.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Weapons[CR]1) Speed Up: Alters your ship's speed. Up to 5 levels, 2 is the recommended dose.[CR]2) Missile: Falls to the ground, then slides along it until it hits something.[CR]3) Double: Fires a bullet at 45 degrees up as well as forward.[CR]4) Laser: Replaces your bullets with a blue beam.[CR]5) Multiple: Orange blobs that follow you around, they have whatever weapons your ship has. You can have up to 4. Possibly the best power-up ever.[CR]6) ?: Force field, 2 blob-things that attach to the nose of your craft.[CR]* Plan your power ups well : When starting/restarting the game, the regular shot being your only method of attack could be very tough. But that doesn't mean increasing your firepower by equipping MULTIPLE very first is good because you cannot move around quickly. You will end up being hit. Therefore, first power up your speed once or twice so you can move faster.[CR]* DOUBLE and its problems : With DOUBLE, you can shoot in front of you and diagonally. However, since you cannot fire rapidly, it is not a weapon easy to use. Equip at least 2 MULTIPLE before equipping DOUBLE.[CR]* Make good use of the LASER : Hitting enemies above and below you with the LASER is rather easy. You don't have to go for a direct hit. Make it fly near the enemy for a slight touch.[CR]* MISSILE movement : The MISSILE moves along the ground. If there is something sticking out of the ground, the MISSILE stops there. Keep an eye on the landscape.[CR]* Take control of the MULTIPLE : The MULTIPLE follow the path of VIC VIPER. Take advantage of this feature and attack enemies that VIC VIPER cannot reach. Use formations to wipe out th enemy![CR]Also, the faster VIC VIPER is, the more widely spread the MULTIPLE are from each other. Take advantage of this feature as well.[CR]* Renewing the BARRIER : The BARRIER wears out not only by making contact with the enemy and enemy shots. It does so by touching the landscape. Make use of this trait and make the BARRIER touch enemies or the landscape to wear it down and get rid of it. Then equip a new BARRIER.[CR]* Come up with a conquering pattern : This game is a shooter that gives you a lot of freedom in terms of how you can conquer levels. Learn the tips, remember the appearance patterns of the enemy, and come up with your own way of conquering the game.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Gradius [Model GX400] (1985)[CR]2.

The amount of truly new material dropped off sharply, and sequels to old favorites that already had a built-in following were in vogue. It was made without the input of the original creators, Shoji Kawamori and Studio Nue, and the resulting series was fairly dire.[CR]The plug was going to be pulled after four episodes, but it sold well amongst anime fans in America (who were starved for Macross of ANY kind at the time), so the US anime company, US Renditions financed the creation of two more episodes. Macross II became the first work of anime to be financed by an American anime company. Fortunately, USR and their notoriously low-quality works are long-gone, the rights to most of their titles having gone to Manga Video, including Macross II. Macross II was officially declared an alternate timeline by Studio Nue, who then made Macross Plus as an official sequel to Macross.

				<plot>Metal Black (c) 1991 Taito Corp.[CR]Earth is under attack from an alien race from the 'Nemesis' region of space, and human civilisation now stands on the brink of collapse. The invaders have utilised energy molecules - known to earth scientists as 'Newalones' - to create powerful beam weapons with which to attack Earth. In response, Earth's scientists have developed the 'Black Fly' project; a powerful space craft that utilises the same Newalone molecule technology of the alien aggressors.[CR]Metal Black is a very playable sideways scrolling shoot-em-up which manages to feel different to other games in the genre, due to the fact that it lacks a a player-definable weapon power-up system. Instead of collecting items that provide extra speed, different weapons etc. players must collect the clusters of 'Newalone' molecules that float around each level. These molecule clusters will gradually increase the player ship's firepower.[CR]As long as the Metal Black ship has sufficient firepower, players can activate the 'Beam Weapon', which generates a powerful energy beam that destroys everything it comes into contact with. The Beam Weapon will only last for a few seconds and its use will reduce the ship's energy levels. Once the Beam weapon de-activates, Metal Black will have vastly reduced firepower for its forward-firing laser cannon. Players must once again collect the Newalone molecule clusters to build up the ship's firepower.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "Taito F2 System" hardware. It used a graphics extension on the board, the so called Taito F2 Expanded System.[CR]Prom Stickers: D12[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Metal Black was released in September 1991. It was a great shoot them up game, but it didn't had the success it merit since it was published at same time of Capcom's "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior".[CR]Metal Black was originally planned to be "Gun Frontier 2", but somewhere in the middle of development, the programmers decided that it had to be a different, unrelated game. Metal black's original storyline was too gloomy. Taito's supervisor rejected the original game project.[CR]This was Taito's first game to show the title of the tune which plays for each stage at the start of each one.[CR]Moriyama Yoshihiro (See Staff section for more info) is the chief of G.rev (makers of "Border Down" in 2003).[CR]The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed it to '***'.[CR]Metal Black was awared by the Gamest Game music section.[CR]The companion star in the story is based on the Nemesis hypothesis as the source of Earth's most notable extinctions.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Metal Black - PCCB-00079) on January 1, 1992.[CR]Zuntata Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Zuntata History L'ab-normal 1st - ZTTL-0038) on April 4, 1999.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* INSTRUCTIONS:[CR]- Press the Fire button to shoot a beam. [CR]- Press and hold the MAX Beam button to shoot a converging beam.[CR]- If your beam level is at maximum, release the MAX Beam button to shoot a spreading beam for greater destructive power. [CR]- Collecting Newalone molecules increases the strength of both your normal and your MAX beam.[CR]- Some enemies also collect Newalone and can fire MAX beams at you. Fire your MAX beam against an enemy MAX beam to create an energy interaction which can cause massive amounts of damage to your enemy - if your beam is stronger.[CR]* LEVELS SELECT:[CR]Boot machine with service switch pressed.[CR]Message appears: SERVICE SWITCH ERROR, press 1p Start(x3), service switch, 1p Start.[CR]Message appears: SELECT BY DOWN SW, select level with joy Down/Up and push Start button.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>P-47 - The Phantom Fighter (c) 1988 Jaleco.[CR]P-47 is a two-dimensional, scrolling shooter type of game. You play as the pilot of a P-47. Your mission is to basically destroy as many of the enemies as you possibly can. This means eliminating as many air and ground units as you can. You will be going through four missions (each being broken up into two parts) and at the end of each of these parts is an enemy boss for you to tangle with. Although you have unlimited ammunition, the enemy will make you pay for the invasion into their homeland. You will be able to accomplish this with various power-ups and also a second player (if they buy in). Your mission won't be easy but it is necessary so you can secure both the skies and ground for our troops.[CR]The game is broken up into four missions. Within these four missions, there are 2 parts. One part involves going over land and the other part has you either going over water or being up in the air. Regardless of which part you are on, you will still have to deal with the same basic things. After part two of mission four, the missions will repeat again with mission one.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Jaleco Mega System 1-A hardware[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 7 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.5 Mhz), (2x) OKI6295 (@ 30.303 Khz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 256 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 1024[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in May 1988.[CR]Developed by Nihon Maicom Kaihatsu (NMK).[CR]This game is known in Japan as "P-47 - The Freedom Fighter".[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (G.S.M. Jaleco 1 - D28B0003) on 12/08/1988.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is complicated. There are a lot of enemy units for you to take out. In addition, some units have multiple parts which also score points. You also get points for collecting items and making it through a mission.

The scores for collection of item power-ups are :[CR]1 ITEM : 1,000 POINTS[CR]2 ITEMS : 2,000 POINTS[CR]3 ITEMS : 3,000 POINTS[CR]4 ITEMS : 4,000 POINTS[CR]5 ITEMS : 5,000 POINTS[CR]6 ITEMS : 10,000 POINTS[CR]7 ITEMS : 20,000 POINTS[CR]8-10 ITEMS : 30,000 POINTS[CR]You will also score 10,000 points for completing a mission part.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]As soon as you start the game, you will immediately be placed into the thick of the action. Be ready for anything.[CR]* This game is very fast-paced and it only gets harder as you progress through the missions. This means you will have to be constantly aware of what is happening from both in the air and on the ground.[CR]* Your fighter has unlimited firepower in both bullets and also auxiliary weapons such as bombs and missiles. Use this to your advantage by laying down a solid wall of firepower to prevent any enemy units from getting close to your fighter.[CR]* Make sure, though, that you are constantly aware of where an enemy unit is because you will also have to gauge where its fire will be heading. In addition, most enemy units move so they basically will 'shoot and scoot' making it harder for you to pinpoint their location.[CR]* To take care of units that like to roam around, lay down a 'carpet' of bombs or other heavy firepower. Your bombs drop down much faster than an enemy unit can move so you can basically overwhelm them with superior firepower.[CR]* Some enemies require more then one hit to take them out. This means you will have to use a combination of different offensive weapons to destroy them. This will be especially true when you are fighting the bosses.[CR]* Make sure you know the lay of the land at all times. Some topography has some extremes in both hills and valleys. Sometimes your only choice is to go above a mountain peak that has a lot of ground and air units guarding it. This means you will have to unleash some serious firepower to make it safely over.[CR]* Ensure that you know how to regulate your speed depending on the current conditions. You can go no further to the front than the right side of the screen nor any further back than the left. Use this speed-up, slow-down to avoid enemy fire and to eliminate targets before they become unmanageable.[CR]* Make sure you eliminate all helicopters that have items so you can ensure you have the right kind of power-up plus you can also get free men.[CR]* When you encounter large formations of planes, the best weapons are the missiles or exploding bombs. These can clear out large holes in those formations plus they can prove rather deadly to the bigger planes as well.[CR]* Overall, this game involves the application of massive amounts of firepower in order to survive the next mission. This isn't to say, however, that paying attention and constantly moving aren't also important... they are vital to your survival.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. P-47 - The Phantom Fighter (1988)[CR]2.

				<plot>Parodius Da! Shinwa kara Owarai e (c) 1990 Konami.[CR]Created as a parody of Konami's own superb and challenging "Gradius" series of shoot-em-ups, Parodius Da! acquired its own identity and would spawn sequels of its own. It maintained the same intuitive power-up system of "Nemesis", "Salamander" et. al. but adopted a graphical style that was entirely its own; something that becomes evident at the very start of the game when players can chose to pilot either a penguin or an octopus rather that the traditional Gradius ship. Parodius' eccentricity and unique humour is further demonstrated soon after the game begins; as players face such enemies as a giant belly-dancing woman and a half-cat/half-boat creature.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Konami TMNT2 Hardware[CR]Game ID : GX955[CR]Main CPU : KONAMI[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151, K053260[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in April 1990.[CR]The title of this game is a combination of two words : Parody + "Gradius" = Parodius. The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'From Myth to Joke', which is a homage to the "Gradius III" subtitle : 'From Legend to Myth'.[CR]During the game's attract mode, potential players are presented with a short history tour of the Nemesis series, as the title screen of each of Parodius's prequels are introduced'; watched, in typical Parodius style, by a crowd of blue and pink penguins.[CR]Pentarou is from the MSX game "Antarctic Adventure".[CR]The second boss (Patrotic Eagle) is similar to the first boss of "Gradius 2" (phoenix). This boss is often coined as a reason why Parodius was never released in the U.S.[CR]The Vegas dancer near the end of the second stage is similar to the robot spider near the end of "Gradius 2". She appears in other Parodius games as well.[CR]Stage 1 crucial part music is a remix of 'Symphony No.9 4th Movement', by Beethoven.[CR]Stage 1 boss music is a remix of 'The Flight of the Bumble Bee', by R. Korsakov.[CR]Stage 2-1 music is a remix of 'Op.71a the Nutcracker', by P.

Khachaturyan.[CR]Stage 5 music is a remix of 'L'Arisienne suite No.2', by G. Bizet.[CR]Stage 6 music is a remix of 'from Gunkan March', by Japanese Martial Song.[CR]Stage 6 boss music is a remix of the music from "Gradius".[CR]Stage 7 music is a remix of 'Op.71a the Nutcracker Valse des Fleurs', by P.

				<plot>Prehistoric Isle in 1930 (c) 1989 SNK.[CR]Prehistoric Isle in 1930 is a horizontally scrolling shooting game developed by SNK and released in arcades in 1989. [CR]Ships have been mysteriously disappearing in the vicinity of the Bahamas for years. Now, in 1930, the United States government sends an expedition to the area in a flying boat to determine the cause. As they survey the ocean, the expedition comes across an uncharted landmass which they dub "Greenhell Isle" and launches two reconnaissance biplanes to take a closer look. As they investigate the island, the biplanes come under attack by dinosaurs and other life forms that were thought to have become extinct millions of years ago. [CR]The player takes control of a biplane armed with a forward-firing machine gun. It can also be equipped with an option weapon pod that can be rotated clockwise around the craft. The option's attack changes depending on where it is currently positioned:[CR]* When directly above or below the plane, the option fires energy waves that reflect back upon contact with a surface.[CR]* When diagonally above the plane, the option fires balls of energy that bounce off surfaces at a 45 degree angle.[CR]* When diagonally below the plane, the option drops bombs.[CR]* When directly in front of the plane, the option replaces the default machine gun with its own flame cannon.[CR]* When directly behind the plane, the option deploys aerial mines.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : A8003 'GT'[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM3812 (@ 4 Mhz), UPD7759 (@ 640 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Pod[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in June 1989.[CR]This game is known in Japan as "Genshi-Tou 1930's".[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version is slightly different, it has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" logo.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

Whereas RayForce players must head toward Earth to destroy it, RayStorm players start at and move away from the planet. The plot of the game is exposed minimally during play, with only dates and place names given at the start of each of its first seven stages. An "Extra Mode" included with home versions of the game displays maps before the first seven stages and a closing crawl after completing the game, which further illustrate the plot; the map for the fifth stage, for example, shows that a "gravity catapult" at the Moon is used to travel from Earth orbit to Secilia orbit.[CR]In a future where space travel has existed since 2119. Humans explored space, and within 100 years Earth established a twenty-colony Star Federation extending to Orion, with each colony kept under martial law. The colonies then mutinied against the Federation: they took control of the major colony Secilia, formed the Secilia Federation and defeated Earth's forces after many battles. After Earth's surrender, all of its inhabitants had been transferred to the colonies. The Secilia Federation suppressed colonial opposition and sent out a force to destroy the planet completely. However, by then the R-Gray, a aircraft made with parts salvaged from 13 different Secilia ships, is completed and deployed to carry out OPERATION RAYSTORM, a desperate attempt to defend Earth from the Federation.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Taito FX-1B hardware[CR]Prom Stickers : E24[CR]Main CPU : PSX (@ 16.9344 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Ray Storm was released in July 1996 in Japan.[CR]The game was originally planned and developed as "R-Gear" (for Ray Gear) on the Taito F3 System hardware.

				<plot>Unlike in most other shoot 'em ups, there are no power-ups. All weapons are available from the start. Weapons can 'level up', however, becoming more powerful as the player uses them to score points. There are a selection of 7 weapons that can be used at any given time:[CR]The game is designed so that there is almost always a 'right' weapon for any situation. The bosses in the game are designed so that they have multiple 'sections' which, if all destroyed before the 'core' of the boss, will award the players with point bonuses. Being able to apply the right weapons on any different boss is key to obtaining these bonuses. For example, a boss may have two sections located on either side of the screen. You could immediately go up to one and begin shooting it with a vulcan, or you could hover in the centre and hit both at the same time with the side bombs. This would increase your chance of obtaining the bonus before the time limit runs out and the boss self-destructs.[CR]The game rewards players for "chaining" enemies of just one of three colors, red, blue, or yellow. Whenever the player kills three enemies that are of the same color, who can obtain a points bonus. This also facilitates faster upgrading of weapons.</plot>

				<plot>R*Type (c) 1987 Irem Corp.[CR]R*Type is a sideways-scrolling shoot-em-up in which the evil Bydo Empire rules the galaxy through fear and intimidation and it's up to the player - piloting their heavily-armed R-9 space ship - to battle through eight tough levels to the heart of the Bydo stronghold and defeat them.[CR]The game's revolutionary weapons system is its real stroke of genius. The first of numerous innovations that R*Type bought to the genre is the beam weapon: when the fire button is held down, a 'power meter' starts to charge up; once the meter is full, releasing the fire button unleashes a very powerful plasma burst capable of inflicting much greater damage to enemy ships or even destroying numerous enemies simultaneously. The trade-off is that charging the weapon takes up valuable seconds, giving the Bydo ships time to attack.[CR]The most significant addition to R-type's arsenal is the now-legendary 'Force Pod'. This takes the form of an invincible, detachable laser-firing pod that can be attached to either the front or rear of the player's ship, or can be detached completely, after which the pod sits some distance either ahead or behind the player's ship, tracking its movements and providing additional fire power. When attached to the R9 ship, the pod acts as a shield. This forms a crucial part of R*Type's gameplay and has to be fully utilised to navigate certain sections of the game, such as the huge mothership that comprises the game's 3rd stage.[CR]R*Type's levels are designed to make full use of its unique weapons system, making for very linear and demanding gameplay in which losing or picking up the wrong weapon at the wrong time often leads to an instant death. Its intelligent, precise and demanding level design, gave the world its first truly 'strategic' shoot-em-up.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Irem M-72 system hardware[CR]Main CPU : V30 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]R*Type was released in July 1987. [CR]Licensed to Nintendo of America for US manufacture and distribution. [CR]R*Type is one of the most famous of all scrolling shooters. Its impressive graphics, detailed animation, inventive features and simple yet surprisingly involved gameplay made it a huge success for Irem. [CR]The first boss, as well as some of the stages, seem inspired by the artistic works of H. R. Giger (of 'Aliens' fame). He makes a brief cameo in the TV sets in "Undercover Cops". [CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack cassette for this game (R*Type : Irem Game Music - 28XA-199) on January 25, 1988.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]At the title screen, the prototype version says 'Play and enjoy the game' instead of 'Blast off and strike the evil Bydo empire!', as it does in the final version.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Force Pod levels:[CR]1) Level 1: Fires single bullet when separated.[CR]2) Level 2: Fires twin shots when separated.[CR]3) Level 3: Fires four shots up, down and forwards when separated.[CR]* Weapons:[CR]1) Speed Up: Alters your ship's speed.[CR]2) Missile: Fires two rather nice homing missiles.[CR]3) Bouncy: Blue lasers bounce around the screen.

				<plot>R*Type II (c) 1989 Irem.[CR]The sequel to the hugely successful original finds the evil Bydo Empire once again intent on the destruction of all mankind in this sideways scrolling, six-level shoot-em-up.[CR]The innovative weapons system of the original game - the 'Beam Weapon' and 'Force Pod' - make a welcome return and remain unchanged for the sequel.[CR]The tight, demanding gameplay and high emphasis on correct usage of the weapons system also return - although the sequel is, if anything, even more demanding than its already unforgiving predecessor; with more durable enemies and trickier level design. [CR]R*Type II features three new weapon shot types: [CR]* Green - Search Laser - fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 45&#176; angles. [CR]* Grey - Shotgun Laser - fires large shells that travel a short distance before exploding powerfully. [CR]* Scatter Bomb - drops bombs to the ground; when these explode, the explosion scatters forwards along the ground. This is a supporting weapon that can be equipped instead of missiles.[CR]In addition to the new weapons, R-type II's Beam Weapon has received an upgrade. As with the first game, holding down the fire button makes a power gauge fill up, releases the button then unleashes a powerful plasma shot. For the sequel, however, continuing to hold down the button causes the gauge to charge up further. This 'double-charged' gauge flashes blue and red and releases an even more powerful plasma burst.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Irem M-82 system hardware (Japanese version has M-84 written on the board).[CR]Main CPU : V30 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), DAC[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]R*Type II was released in December 1989.

				<plot>R*Type Leo (c) 1992 Irem.[CR]R-Type Leo is a horizontally-scrolling shoot-em-up and is the third and final arcade release of this classic series (although numerous console-only sequels would follow, see 'Series' for details).[CR]Mankind are currently at peace with their former adversaries, the Bydo Empire, and have taken the opportunity to undertake a massive project called 'Project Paradise'. This involved the construction of an artificial terrestrial-like planet called 'Eden', created as a safe haven should humanity once again find itself under threat. However, soon after construction is completed, 'Major' - the bio-computer system responsible for maintaining Eden - malfunctions, taking control of the planet's defences and launching an attack on mankind. It is up to the newly-developed 'R-9 Leo' fleet to fly in and stop Major's assault on its creators.[CR]R-Type Leo deviates from the gameplay style of its predecessors by removing the use of both the 'Force Pod' and the 'Wave Cannon'. The new weapons are called 'Force Bits' (later identified in "R-Type Final" as "Psy Bits") and the 'Bit Shot'. The three 'Force Bit' weapon types are:[CR]* Red - Claw Laser: a powerful horizontal laser beam and horizontal traverse wave[CR]* Blue - Mirror Laser: fires multiple, ricocheting lasers.[CR]* Green - Search Laser LRG: fires semi-homing lasers that can bend at 90 degree angles.[CR]Unlike previous 'Bit' devices, the 'Force/Psy Bits' are capable of firing either forwards or backwards (their direction dictated by the movement of the ship itself). Finally, the 'Wave Cannon' is replaced by a 'Bit Shot', in which the Psy Bits detach from the ship and collide with the nearest enemy. The Bits can only do this for a limited time before running out of energy, and must be recalled to the ship to recharge.[CR]R Type Leo consists of 6 stages and is the first game in the series to allow 2 players to play simultaneously.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Irem M-92 system hardware[CR]Main CPU : V33 (@ 9 Mhz), V30 (@ 7.15909 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), GA20 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 320 x 240 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 2048[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in December 1992.[CR]R*Type Leo was developed by Irem's internal group, 'Nanao' (authors of the famous "Meikyuu Jima"); the original authors of R*Type's series moved to 'Aicom' (bought by SNK) and went on to develop another superb shoot-em-up, "Pulstar"; released in 1995.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Salamander (c) 1986 Konami.[CR]Salamander is a 1 or 2 player sequel to 1985's superb shoot-em-up, "Nemesis". While it retained the same basic gameplay and feel of its predecessor (particularly the superb and innovative weapons system), Salamander featured both superior graphics and a more imaginative approach to level design. The earliest example of the latter appears towards the end of the very first level, in which imposing, organic obstructions grow before the players' eyes. The game's third level - the infamous 'lava' level - is another good example of Salamander's superb design; with huge solar flares constantly erupting both above and below the player's ship that must be carefully navigated to avoid instant loss of life. Salamander introduced further variety to the action with the introduction vertically-scrolling levels, which alternated with the standard side-scrolling levels.[CR]Salamander's weapon power-up system is as follows :[CR]* SPEED UP : Five speed levels.[CR]* MISSILE : Press missile button to launch.[CR]* LASER : Your forward rockets turn into deadly lasers.[CR]* RIPPLE LASER : Use shoot button to fire.[CR]* FORCE FIELD : Protect your ship with barriers.[CR]* MULTIPLE : Increase your fire power by up to four times.[CR]Multiple special powers can be obtained, but the LASER cannot be used in conjunction with the RIPPLE Laser.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Konami Nemesis Hardware[CR]Game ID : GX587[CR]Main CPU : MC 68000 @ 10Mhz / G400 Bios[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80[CR]Sound chip : 2x AY-3-8910 psg[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Salamander was released in July 1986 in Japan. It is known in US as "Lifeforce", but it was re-released one year later in Japan as "Lifeforce [Model GX587]" (June 1987).[CR]Salamander is the game that inspired Ikeda Tsunemoto (Toaplan&gt;Cave) to develop the 'Danmaku'; the shot patterns seen in "Donpachi" et al.[CR]Note: The kanji on the Japanese version title screen actually reads 'Sa Ra Man Da', meaning 'Sand Gauze Wide Snake'. This is an example of 'ateji', where Japanese artists use the phonetic value of a character to fit the game's name allowing them to write the name in kanji as opposed to a kana.[CR]The first boss in Salamander appears as BRAIN GOLEM in "Kyukyoku Sentai Dadandarn".[CR]Soundtrack releases:[CR][JP] [Cassette] Dec. 16, 1986; Original Sound of Salamander [KHY-1012][CR][JP] [Cassette] Nov.21, 1987; Original Sound of Gradius &amp; Salamander [Battle Music Collection][CR][JP] [Audio CD] (Nov.21, 1987) Original Sound of Gradius &amp; Salamander [Battle Music Collection][CR][JP] Nov. 21, 1988; Original Sound of Salamander [BY12-5019][CR][JP] May 25, 1992; Salamander Again - Konami Kukeiha Club [KICA-7601][CR][JP] May 21, 1998; Salamander - Kukeiha Club Pro-Fusion [KICA-7702][CR][JP] Apr. 09, 2003; Salamander Arcade Soundtrack [KOLA-030][CR][JP] Sep. 22, 2011; Konami Shooting Collection [LC-2039~48][CR]The story between the different versions of Salamander differs. While the story in the arcade original is not entirely clear, the Famicom version claims a large creature named Zelos (possibly the serpent often pictured on the game's cover art) is preparing to swallow your planet whole, and you must stop it from the inside out. The US arcade follows primarily the same story. the Japanese LifeForce may have a more surgery-related story, involving the removal of an unwanted virus or microbe from the body. The MSX version of Salamander differs the most from any of these. Basically, a prophecy from long ago comes true when an army attacks Latis and it's surrounding planets. They have created a barrier around Latis, and the only way to undo it is by activating a 'crush below' system created by ancient Latisians.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Bypass the mini-boss in stage 6: In stage 6 (Zelos's fortress if you're playing Salamander or the brain area if you're playing Life Force), there is a mini-boss section consisting of multiple boss ships that fire sets of 4 lasers. Move your ship all the way to the top of the screen and you will be safe until this section ends. This glitch does not work in the Japanese re-release version of the game (the one with a purple background in attract mode).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Gradius [Model GX400] (1985)[CR]2.

				<plot>Sexy Parodius (c) 1996 Konami Company, Limited.[CR]The 3rd sequel in a hugely successful series of games that was originally intended to be little more than a parody of Konami's own successful "Gradius" series. As the previous "Parodius" games, "Sexy Parodius" again gives the player a choice of increasingly bizarre ships to control; ranging from a sexy girl riding a missile, to a stick man on a paper aeroplane.[CR]The game plays much the same as its prequels, as well as the 'Gradius' series it sets out to parody. One new addition to the game-play is the introduction of branching paths through the game. Each level has a specific task, such as collecting the golden coins on the second level, the completion or failure of which dictates which level players will be faced with next.[CR]Due to the powerful Konami GX hardware the game runs on, Sexy Parodius's colorful and inventive visuals represent the pinnacle of the series.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Konami GX Hardware[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68EC020[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola 68000[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) K054539[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; Power Up, Fire, Missile[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Sexy Parodius was released in March 1996.[CR]World 3-A (get the 300 coins in World 2) will appeal to fans of Konami's classic game "Yie Ar Kung-Fu" (Oolong makes a guest appearance just before reaching the stage boss and you can even knock him out!).[CR]World 3-B (do not get the 300 coins in World 2) is a hilarious parody of Konami's "CastleVania" series (the well-known Medusa makes a guest appearance as the stage's boss!).[CR]The name of the fish character Mambo has a double meaning, he gets his name from the real life fish called Ocean Sunfish (or Mola Mola), but called Mambou in Japan. The other meaning is Mambo from the musical style, which is why the female partner character in this game is called Samba, yet another musical style.[CR]Character selection screen music is a remix of 'Twinkle Twinkle Little Star', by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.[CR]The music theme of Shooting Star comes from "Twin Bee Yahhoo!

				<plot>Hyper Dyne SIDE ARMS (c) 1986 Capcom.[CR]An evil alien race called the 'Bozon' are trying to wipe out Mankind, and Lieutenant Henry and Sergent Sanders are given the responsibility of saving the Human Race. They each climb into a Mobilsuit - a jet-powered, heavily armoured combat suit - and set out on their mission. [CR]Side Arms is a horizontally - and occasionally vertically - scrolling shoot-em-up for one or two players. Each player has two fire buttons, one for shooting ahead and one for shooting behind; crucial for a game in which enemies attack from all directions. Shooting certain enemies will reveal power-ups - displayed as 'POW' icons - and shooting the icons will either change their type, or reveal a special weapon. [CR]Finally, Side Arms features a unique power-up. These power-ups are hidden in the level and can be collected by shooting at their location with any weapon. By collecting a circle icon that flashed between the Greek 'Beta' and ok, both players can join together to become a single, highly powerful combat unit capable of firing in eight different directions. When a two-player unit is joined, BOTH players' controllers can control the unit's movement, which can cause the unit to not move if players decide to go in different directions to each other. The player who picks up this power-up will control the main weapon from his current list only and the other player will be able to fire the secondary eight-direction weapon. The eight-direction weapon can be fired by single presses or automatically by holding either fire button. [CR]In a two-player game, this form will break apart after one hit to the unit, returning to both players individual units. In a one-player game it will break apart after two hits, causing the second unit to be destroyed. [CR]Appearance of the super unit and the eight-directional weapon is dependant on which player gets the power-up. First-player unit is a primarily orange unit that fires red triangle projectiles one way. Second-player unit is a blue unit that fires blue boomerangs that fly out and return causing a slower rate of fire. [CR]The 8 available power-ups are : [CR]* Speed-up (POW symbol) [CR]* Speed-down (Reverse POW symbol, shows just before reaching Auto I or II) [CR]* Bit - (3 level power-up) [CR]* Spread Gun - (3 level power-up) [CR]* Mega Bazooka Launcher (2 level power-up) [CR]* 3-Way Shot (2 level power-up) [CR]* Auto I (Chain gun) [CR]* Auto II (3-Way Auto) [CR]Players are able to carry all of the game's available weapons simultaneously and can switch between each one to suit the situation. All weapons can also be powered-up by collecting a similar option.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : (2x) Yamaha YM2203 (@ 4 Mhz) [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Hyper Dyne Side Arms was released in November 1986.[CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Capcom Game Music Vol.2 - 28XA-203) on March 25, 1988.

				<plot>Sonic Wings 2 (c) 1994 Video System.[CR]The first sequel to the superb vertically scrolling shoot-em-up "Sonic Wings", players once again take control of a Jet fighter aircraft and take to the skies to destroy enemy jets, boats, helicopters, gun emplacements and huge end-of-level bosses. The graphics are every bit as accomplished as those of the prequel and the game delivers a good level of challenge.[CR]The end-of-level bosses change from game-to-game; a nice touch that adds variety to an already solid game.[CR]Players can choose to play as any one of eight different fighter pilots, each of which pilots a different jet :[CR]* American F-117A Nighthawk piloted by Robo-Keaton. [CR]* American A-10 Thunderbolt II piloted by Mao Mao. [CR]* Japanese Fighter-Support X piloted by Hien. [CR]* Japanese F-15 Eagle piloted by Captain Silver.

So try out different pair combinations in order to see some truly wacky endings![CR]In one part of the city in the Japan stage, you can see Red Rabbit (from "Rabio Lepus") on a sign, a poster of Mao Mao, a small sign with Mambu on it, and of course that infamous 'Heroin Magic' sign. Also, Check out the theme park in the U.S.A. stage. Among the rides, you can see the Red Rabbit, Tenukie, and Mambu.[CR]There are three last bosses in the game, but they appear randomly. The most common one is Lar, a giant black sphere with an eye. The second rarest one is Tenukii, a white sheet ghost. And the third and most difficult to get is Mambu, a giant sunfish. You can get three bad endings if you let the last bosses escape.[CR]There are a total of 47 endings in the game. Eight are for the individual character endings, twenty-eight are for the team endings, three are for the bad endings and eight for beating the 2nd loop with each character.[CR]The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table.

Amidst the depression and its riots of jobless workers, a mad scientist starts his plan of world domination. Taking command in the titular fortress orbiting Earth, the evil Doctor Gegeben Funkerun uses his own robots, flying fortresses and mercenaries to wreak havoc across the globe until all his demands are met. Assisting the attacked and weakened governments, workers across the nations help develop a series of jet fighters called the Aizerun Geist to use against the forces of Dr. Funkerun and save the world.[CR]Before each stage begins, players are given a choice of weapons to purchase at a hangar for the Aizerun Geist. There are four weapons within three tiers to choose from including Main Attack, Sub Weapon and Bomb. Of the Main Attack the player can choose Twin Shot, Laser, Heavy Laser and the Charge Shot. Of the Sub Weapons, players can choose additional firepower, Homing Missiles, Shielded Options or an energy barrier.

				<plot>Twin Bee Yahhoo! Fushigi no Kuni de Dai Abare!! (c) 1995 Konami.[CR]Twin Bee Yahho! differs from Detana!! TwinBee in that the player can adjust their playing style before starting the game to suit their preference. The player begins by choosing between three difficulty settings: Practice, Normal, and Special. Practice course is the game's easiest setting and lasts only three stages, whereas the Special course is the hardest setting and is recommended to expert players. The player will then select between four different charged shots. The regular Charge Shot from Detana! TwinBee is selectable, along with a Charge Punch, a Charge Split (which will cause the player's ship to shoot duplicates of itself), and a Charge Explosion that fires at eight directions at the same time. The player will then choose between two control styles: one which fires the gun with one button and drops bombs with the second, while the other style shoots and drops bomb at the same time with a single button (either button can be used).[CR]Like in previous Twin Bee games, there are two kinds of power-ups: bell power-ups obtained from the sky and land power-ups that can be retrieved from destroy ground enemies. The bells can be changed to up to six colors this time (yellow, blue, white, green, red, and pink), each with a unique attribute. GwinBee returns as well as a power-up item, along with the twin attacks that can be performed with GwinBee or another player.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Konami GX hardware[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68EC020[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola 68000[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) K054539[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Twin Bee Yahhoo! was released in April 1995.[CR]The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Uproar In A Mysterious Land'.[CR]The J-Pop song played in attract mode (make sure that get it via the dipswitches) is called 'Bokura no Suteki' and is sung by Mariko Kouda.

				<plot>Thunder Cross II (c) 1991 Konami.[CR]Taking place in the future of space colonization, the planet Haniamu IV is under attack from a relentless, unknown military force known only as Black Impulse. The strongest Earth ships capable of stopping the total conquering of the planet are the Blue Thunder M-45 (player 1) and the Red Thunder M-24 (player 2).[CR]Thunder Cross is a classic horizontal shooter with 7 stages. Players control the Thunder fighter with up to four "options", which arrange up and down vertically and add to the player's attack power. Three weapons are selectable ranging from the Vulcan shot to the Laser and the Boomerang shot (which doubles as a ricochet weapon). Typical of a Konami shooter, Thunder Cross forces the player to beat the game twice in a harder loop of the first seven levels.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX073[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), K053260 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 288 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 2048[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.4 - KICA-7505) on 05/10/1991.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Shmups Horiz - Twinkle Star Sprites</title_clean>
				<plot>Twinkle Star Sprites (c) 1997 SNK.[CR]Twinkle Star Sprites is a competitive scrolling shooter game originally created by ADK. It was ADK's last production for the Neo-Geo platform. The gameplay, which can be characterized as a combination of a fixed shooter and a versus puzzle game, uses combinations of shots, as well as timed power-ups to attempt to damage the opponent. These attacks also serve as counters to the opponent's attack.[CR]An interesting &amp; highly cute hybrid between a Vs style puzzle game &amp; an overhead shooter, players may choose to play the Story Mode in order to see the misadventures of Load Ran &amp; her faithful yet somewhat annoying Rabbicat as they try to find the Magical Twinkle Star &amp; save their world from the evil Mevious &amp; his henchmen. The other option is to play the Free Character Mode in which you are able to pick any character (see codes under Tips and Tricks) to play the game and see their very own comical ending. A second player may challenge you at any time.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0224[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2b[A] Shoot/Use attack-stopper, [B] Bomb[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Twinkle Star Sprites was released in January 1997.[CR]The game's concept seems to be a funny parody of the Sailor Moon manga, however the game's comic relief 'Rabbicat' seems to be a parody of Tenchi Muyo's very own cute mascot &amp; comic relief 'Ryo-Oh-Ki' the cabbit.[CR]Load Ran &amp; Sprites feature different endings in the Free Character Mode, these endings are completely different to the one seen in the Story Mode.[CR]In the story mode, Mevious will either taunt or praise you if continues have been used during your game or not![CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Twinkle Star Sprites - PCCB-00247) on 21/02/1997.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]There are two types of standard attacks: a normal shot and a charge-up shot. Each character starts with two bombs which enables him in the event of desperate plight, to clean with the screen while briefly acquiring a state of invincibility. The two players' playfields are separated by a vertical bar, each one having its own independent of the other. Series of enemies arrive from the top of the screen. The player is to successfully destroy them in chains (combos), which will send one or more fireball projectiles to the screen of his adversary (Normal Attack). Shooting at Normal Attacks several times reflects them back as glowing Reverse Attacks. If Reverse Attacks are reflected again, a number of powerful counterattacks in the shape of one or more indestructible enemies appear (Extra Attack). Reflecting many Reverse Attacks at once can instead summon a boss (Boss Attack).[CR]* The Extra Attacks and the Boss Attack vary from one character to another.[CR]* The power gauge fills as the player destroys enemies up to three levels. By holding down the fire button and releasing when a certain level is reached, the player can launch a character-specific charge shot to assist the player in clearing enemies from his screen. At Level 1, the charge shot is launched. At Level 2, the charge shot and three Extra Attacks against the opponent are launched. At Level 3 (Max Level), the charge shot and a Boss Attack are launched. Firing charge shots at Level 2 and above will decrease the power gauge.[CR]* 30&#8211;40 seconds into a round, a blue orb appears among a chain of enemies. If this orb is destroyed in a chain, the player achieves Fever status for the next several seconds. Chains created during Fever generate faster and more plentiful Normal Attacks per enemy destroyed, which can prove to be very dangerous to the opponent if large chains are made.[CR]* Both players are given five life points at the start of a round.[CR]* Colliding into an enemy costs 1 life point, but the player cannot be killed this way; if a player has one life point left, he will be left with one half of a life point. When this happens, his character is stunned for a short while and is reduced in speed and attack power for several seconds after recovery, all the while left more vulnerable to opponent attacks.[CR]* Getting hit by a Normal Attack, Reverse Attack, Extra Attack or the projectiles from a Boss cost 3 life points.[CR]    [CR]* The match is over when a player loses all his life points.[CR]* When a player takes damage, his opponent recovers life points equal to half of the damage taken.[CR]* If a round lasts longer than 100 seconds or the player does not fire a shot for more than 30 seconds, a Death enemy appears. If a player is hit by this enemy, he will lose immediately (Death Attack). The Death can be destroyed as any other enemy, but always comes back, harder to kill. Additionally, if a player is successful in volleying the "death" character over to his opponent's side, and the death character touches the opponent, the opponent dies instantly.

The score for each consecutive bomber destroyed without the player dying is 500 points more than the previous one, up to a maximum of 9,000 points. When the player&#8217;s ship is destroyed, the score for the bombers is reset back to 2,000 points.[CR]There are four boss planes. They appear at the end of stages 26, 18, 10, and 02 :  [CR]The stage 26 boss plane is worth 20,000 points.[CR]The stage 18 boss plane is worth 30,000 points.[CR]The stage 10 boss plane is worth 40,000 points.[CR]The stage 02 boss plane is worth 50,000 points.[CR]For all enemy planes that require more than one hit to kill, each hit on them gives 100 points.[CR]At the end of each stage a bonus is awarded for shooting down percentage and for unused loops :[CR]100% = Special bonus 50,000 points (in older revisions, the game displays 10,000 points bonus but 50,000 points are actually awarded).[CR]95-99% = 20,000 points[CR]90-94% = 10,000 points[CR]85-89% = 5,000 points[CR]80-84% = 4,000 points[CR]70-79% = 3,000 points[CR]60-69% = 2,000 points[CR]50-59% = 1,000 points[CR]Under 50% = 0 points[CR]Unused loops are 1,000 points each.[CR]Finishing the final stage awards 10,000,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* On Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04, a V-formation of red planes will come straight down from the top. If all five of the planes are destroyed, a Black/Red POW appears, giving the player an extra airplane when picked up.[CR]* On stages with the wingman power-ups, use them to kill off the large bombers easily by crashing a wingman into them. You will get a second chance to get them back later on.[CR]* On the stages with the boss planes, save all your loops; shoot at it quickly, loop down to avoid the shots, shoot at it again and THEN loop. You should be able to kill it this way.[CR]* Most of the time it is easier to keep only one wingman rather than both; that way it's easier to maneuver around enemies. If you miss the red airplanes that give you the wingman powerup, kill off your plane (assuming you have some remaining) and the game will place you back before them.[CR]* An interesting bug : If you win an extra plane from points when killing a boss plane, no extra planes will be awarded on the basis of points. Extra planes can still be obtained by getting the Black/Red POW, but no point-based bonuses will be awarded for the rest of the game.[CR]* The end of stage bonus for 100% shooting down is actually 50,000 points, even though the game displays a 'special' bonus of only 10,000 points.[CR]When the player loses all of his ships, the game offers to continue for another credit. If this option is chosen, the game continues where it left off but the score is reset to zero.[CR]* There are six kinds of powerups : Quad fire, destroy all enemies on screen, two wingmen, make enemies stop shooting temporarily, extra loop, and extra life. Note that the destroy all enemies powerup does not destroy the small slow plane that has the 5,000 bonus item pickup.[CR]Quad fire power-ups are found on Stages 32, 28, 24, 20, 16, 12, 08, and 04.[CR]Destroy all enemies power-ups are found on Stages 31, 21, 19, 18, 11, 07, 03, and 01.[CR]Wingman power-ups are found on Stages 30, 26, 22, 18, 14, 10, 06, and 02.[CR]Extra life power-ups are found on Stages 27, 20, 15, 08, and 04.[CR]Stop shooting power-ups are found on Stages 27 and 15. [CR]Extra loop power-ups are found on Stages 23, 18, 17, 13, 09, and 05.[CR]* % and point up Stages are 29, 25, 21, 17, 13, 09, 05, 01. During these stages none of the enemies fire on the player except the large bomber planes.[CR]* If the player earns enough bonus planes so that ten ships or more are in the reserve, the ten remaining ships indicators are replaced by the Greek letter Sigma (?).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. 1942 (1984) [CR]2. 1943 - Midway Kaisen (1987) [CR]3. 1943 Kai - Midway Kaisen (1988) [CR]4. 1941 - Counter Attack [B-Board 89625B-1] (1990) [CR]5. 19XX - The War Against Destiny [Green Board] (1995) [CR]6. 1944 - The Loop Master [Green Board] (2000)[CR]7. 1942 - Joint Strike (2008, PSN/XBLA)[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Designed &amp; programmed by : Yoshiki Okamoto[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR][JP] Nintendo Famicom (December 11, 1985) "1942 [Model CAP-19]" [CR][US] Nintendo NES (November 1986) "1942 [Model NES-NF-USA]" [CR][JP] Sega Saturn (August 27, 1998) "Capcom Generation Dai 1 Shou Gekkitsui Oh no Jidai [Model T-1232G]" [CR][JP] Sony PlayStation (August 27, 1998) "Capcom Generation Dai 1 Shou Gekkitsui Oh no Jidai [Model SLPS-01535]" [CR][EU] Sony PlayStation (September 3, 1999) "Capcom Generations 1 - Wings of Destiny [Capcom Generations Disc 1] [Model SLES-01881]" [CR][US] Microsoft XBOX (September 27, 2005) "Capcom Classics Collection" [CR][US] Sony PlayStation 2 (September 27, 2005) "Capcom Classics Collection [Model SLUS-21316]" [CR][EU] Microsoft XBOX (November 18, 2005) "Capcom Classics Collection" [CR][EU] Sony PlayStation 2 (November 18, 2005) "Capcom Classics Collection [Model SLES-53661]" [CR][JP] Sony PlayStation 2 (March 2, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection [Model SLPM-66317]" [CR][JP] Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console Arcade] (December 21, 2010) [CR][AU] [EU] Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console Arcade] (January 21, 2011) [CR][US] Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console Arcade] (January 24, 2011) [CR][JP] Sony PlayStation 3 [PSN] (February 19, 2013) "Capcom Arcade Cabinet [Model NPJB-00210]" [CR][EU] Sony PlayStation 3 [PSN] (February 20, 2013) "Capcom Arcade Cabinet" [CR][JP] Microsoft XBOX 360 [XBLA] (February 20, 2013) "Capcom Arcade Cabinet" [CR][EU] Microsoft XBOX 360 [XBLA] (February 20, 2013) "Capcom Arcade Cabinet" [CR][AU] Microsoft XBOX 360 [XBLA] (February 21, 2013) "Capcom Arcade Cabinet" [CR][US] Sony PlayStation 3 [PSN] (April 16, 2013) "Capcom Arcade Cabinet: Game Pack 5 [DLC]" [CR][US] Microsoft XBOX 360 [XBLA] (April 17, 2013) "Capcom Arcade Cabinet: Game Pack 5 [DLC]" [CR][US] Sony PlayStation 3 [PSN] (May 21, 2013) "Capcom Arcade Cabinet: All-In-One Pack [DLC]" [CR][US] Microsoft XBOX 360 [XBLA] (May 22, 2013) "Capcom Arcade Cabinet: All-In-One Pack [DLC]" [CR]* Handhelds : [CR][US] Nintendo Game Boy Color (May 2000) "1942 [Model CGB-AQ4E-USA]" [CR][EU] Nintendo Game Boy Color (August 24, 2001) "1942 [Model CGB-AQ4E-EUR]" [CR][JP] Sony PSP (September 7, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection [Model ULJM-05104]" [CR][US] Sony PSP (October 24, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded [Model ULUS-10134]" [CR][EU] Sony PSP (November 10, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded [Model ULES-00377]" [CR][AU] Sony PSP (November 16, 2006) "Capcom Classics Collection Reloaded" [CR]* Computers : [CR][EU] Sinclair ZX Spectrum (1986) [CR][US] [EU] Commodore C64 (1986) [CR][JP] MSX (1986) [CR][JP] MSX2 (1986) [CR][EU] Amstrad CPC [Disk] (1986) by Elite [CR][EU] Amstrad CPC [Tape] (1986) Encore Edition by MCM [CR][EU] Amstrad CPC [Tape] (1986) Elite [CR][EU] Sinclair ZX Spectrum (1987) Budget Edition [CR][EU] Sinclair ZX Spectrum (1987) Encore Edition by Elite [CR][EU] Sinclair ZX Spectrum (1987) Encore Edition by MCM [CR][JP] FM-7 (May 1987) [CR][EU] Amstrad CPC (1987) "6-Pak" [CR][EU] Amstrad CPC (1988) "Frank Bruno's Big Box" [CR][EU] Amstrad CPC (1989) "12 Top Amstrad Hits" [CR][EU] Amstrad CPC (1990) "Top 17" [CR][US] PC [CD-ROM](2003) "Capcom Arcade Hits Volume 2" [CR][US] PC [CD-ROM] (December 21, 2004) "Capcom Coin-Op Collection Volume 1"[CR]* Others : [CR][US] Apple iPhone/iPad (November 4, 2010) "Capcom Arcade [Model 397347348]"[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Airgallet (c) 1996 Banpresto.[CR]The player controls a fighter jet and shoot enemies in the air and on the ground, collects power-ups, and defeat bosses to advance levels. The player must collect four power ups to upgrade their weapon. There are four weapon types: L, a laser weapon, S, a support drone, M, a tracing missile, and F, gatling Fire, a spread-out vulcan bullet shot.[CR]Four levels of power-ups are available for each weapon, however each level requires four power up tokens be collected. There are also two special "bomb" weapons available for collection - green Energy Spark for a screen-covering swarm of lower-power bombs and blue Thunder Drive for a narrower and more focused attack. The Energy Spark clears all bullets from the screen, while the Thunder Drive only clears bullets that actually touch the blast. This blast starts momentarily atop the player, but quickly moves forward a short distance and stays stationary for a few seconds before dissipating.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Cave 1st Generation Hardware[CR]Game ID: BP962A[CR]Main CPU: MC68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU: Zilog Z80 [Optional][CR]Sound Chips: OKIM6295 + Yamaha YM2151[CR]Other: 93C46 EEPROM[CR]RAM: 62256 (x8), NEC 424260 (x2), 6264 (x5)[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in February 1996, Air Gallet features the voices of Lenne Hardt and Jeff Manning.[CR]This game was developed by Gazelle Co, Ltd., one of the offshoots of shooter greats Toaplan (along with Cave and Eighting/Raizing).[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Executive producer : Johan Satoh[CR]Total coordinator : Toshifumi Kawashima[CR]Producer : Hiroyuki Fujimoto[CR]Director : Tatsuya Uemura[CR]Programmer : Mizuiro Honey[CR]Graphic designers : Mikio Yamaguchi, Junya Inoue, Kaneyo Oohira[CR]Music composer : Yoshitatsu Sakai (Yoshitaz)[CR]Special thanks : S.

If you try, it gets changed to 'H!?'.[CR]If you beat the game in Single Character mode with Car-Pet, she says she's off to work on a great RPG and it shows a parody of the original Nintendo Famicom Dragon Quest boxart called 'Car-Pet Storys'.[CR]In the Secret Stage, you fight the first and last boss of Razing/8ing's game "Sokyugrentai".[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1 :[CR]* Software version : A.[CR]* Japan release only.[CR]Revision 2 :[CR]* Software version : B.[CR]* Japan release only.[CR]Revision 2 (Alternate) :[CR]* Software version : B.[CR]* Korea release only.[CR]* Enabled 'Special Course', 'Guest Players' and 'Player Select' codes by default.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Medals score : As long as you catch all medals of a wave, the increasing continues up to 10,000 points per medal.

This can also be enabled by setting a DIP switch.[CR]* Guest Players : insert a coin and press Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, FIRE, BOMB, START. Nine additional fighters from "Battle Garegga" and "Mahou Daisakusen" will be unlocked. This can also be enabled by setting a DIP switch.[CR]* Player Select : with this mode enabled you can select one ship instead of a team. Insert a coin and press Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, BOMB, FIRE, START. This can also be enabled with a DIP switch.[CR]* Score Mode : to show up score calculations, start from anywhere in the game, hold the START button and press BOMB (To leave the score mode, re-enter the code).[CR]* Special Course : at the title screen, press Up, Down, Up, Down, Left, Right, Left, Right, A, B, START. This will enable a fourth 'Boss Attack' game mode. This can also be enabled with a DIP switch.[CR]* Garegga Option Formation Codes : the Garegga ships are unique in that their options can be set to a variety of different formations. Typically, this is done by pushing button C, just as in "Battle Garegga". However, since Batrider is 'officially' a 2-button PCB, some cabinets may not have a third button. If you're stuck playing on one of these cabs, use these "Street Fighter" moves instead :[CR]Front : up, down, A[CR]Back : down, up, down, A[CR]Wide : right, down, down-right, A[CR]Control : left, down, down-left, A[CR]Rolling : left, down-left, down, down-right, right, A[CR]* Garegga Option Special Formations : just like in "Battle Garegga", you can get unique (and in most cases powerful) option formation upgrades by collecting items in special sequence :[CR]Wide : miss 5 small shot items, then pick up an option item. Options shoot out to the sides in a very wide pattern.[CR]Search : miss 5 option items, pick up an option item. Options automatically aim themselves at enemies.[CR]Homing : miss 5 bomb icons, pick up an option item. Options fly right up to enemies and shoot them.[CR]Shadow : miss 5 bonus medals, pick up an option item. Options follow your ship a la Gradius.[CR]Rolling : miss 5 large shot items, pick up an option item. Options roll around your ship while still shooting forwards.[CR]* Ingame Commands : press these button combinations during play to customize the game's bullet patterns. Note that the START+A and START+C combinations affect only your ship, and not the enemies :[CR]Increase your ship's firing rate : START+A[CR]Decrease your firing rate : START+C, or Start+Up (B ver. only)[CR]Score Display : START+B (displays points given for destroying enemies)[CR]Change color of round bullets : START+Left[CR]Change color of straight bullet : START+Down[CR]Change color of destructible bullets : START+Right[CR]* Secret Extend Items : an extend item will drop after each 1.5 million points. In addition, there are two secret methods for triggering extends :[CR]1) Kill the Highway Stage's blue hovercraft only after it's stopped.[CR]2) Miss 3 max bomb items.[CR]Missing three extend items and collecting the fourth will yield a 'special extend', refilling all your empty life slots.[CR]* Galaxy Valhallyzer : this is Gain's 'dream machine' from the "Mahou Daisakusen" games. In Batrider, you can actually play as this ship for the first time, although it's not particularly useful. To get it, you must be playing as Gain. Miss an extend item with no options on your ship, and collect the next option you see. Your ship will now transform into the the 'Galaxy Valhallyzer'. It can be difficult to reach 1.5 million points without using options, so it's easiest to just suicide to drop your options right before you hit the extend.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Program 68000 side : Shinobu Yagawa[CR]Program Z80 side : Yuichi Ochiai[CR]Character designer : Kazuyuki Nakashima[CR]Graphic designers : Kazuyuki Nakashima, H.

				<plot>Batsugun (c) 1993 Toaplan.[CR]A vertically scrolling shoot'em up game. As is the standard with most arcade shooters, the player controls their ship with a joystick and two buttons. One button (Fire) shoots the main guns, and the other button (Bomb) releases a smart bomb that spreads huge energy balls all around the player's ship.[CR]As enemies are destroyed, the player gains experience points that are separate from the score. For every 288 experience points gained, the main gun will 'level up', becoming much stronger. This is analogous to experience points and leveling up in role playing games. The weapon can only level up twice, so after it has achieved its maximum level, 288 experience points will grant the player an extra bomb.[CR]The player can also grab P icons to increase the power of the current level gun. A maximum of five "P"s can be collected per experience level; getting more after this gives extra points instead.[CR]Collecting B icons increases the number of bombs, to a maximum of 7.[CR]Apart from destroying enemies, points can be gained from collecting golden V-shaped medals. After the level is finished, 3000 points are awarded for every small one, and 5000 points for every large one. If the player's ship is destroyed during a level, all medals collected are lost.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : TP-030[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.375 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 24.242 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Shot, [B] Bomb[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Batsugun was released in February 1993.[CR]BATSUGUN means 'Preeminence', 'Predominace' or 'By far the best'.[CR]BATSU means 'Dominant', 'Outstanding' or 'Excel'.[CR]GUN is originaly 'Group' or 'Brigade', but also means 'Common Level'.[CR]BATSU also means a cross (X) mark, so there's an X under the logo of Batsugun.[CR]Licensed to Taito for world distribution and to Unite Trading for Korea.[CR]This is the last shoot'em up and the first 'non-endless' game by Toaplan. A special version of Batsugun existed, originally it was only for the AOU show (Arcade Operators Union, an arcade game show held in Japan every year) and not for sale. After the Toaplan bankruptcy, the board started to appear on the second hand market.[CR]Heralded by some as the first 'maniac shooter', Batsugun involved employees who would go on to form and work at Cave and continue to work in this subgenre. Batsugun saw an evolution in the use of complex bullet and enemy patterns and player fire power and hit-box.[CR]The scoring trick on the fourth boss (destroy the two giant laser cannons, let the tanks appearing from the hangars fill the ramps and become red, bomb for 59,630 points a tank) was one source of inspiration for "Battle Garegga"'s gameplay.[CR]Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Batsugun - PCCB-00151) on 18/03/1994.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hidden Functions : If the 'Invulnerability dip switch' is enabled, you are invulnerable but you may also 'Pause' the game with P2 Start and restart with P1 Start.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Excecutive producer : Yuko Tataka[CR]Programmers : Suki!

Once you lose a multiplier, your medals revert back to 10k points medals.[CR]* Multiplier System : Bakraid features another scoring system that alters the amount of points gained from enemy destruction by modifying the base point gain from enemy destruction with a specially acquired incremental multiplier. The multiplier system is the more important of the two scoring systems as it is the system that can contribute to almost 80% of your total score, and is centric to the release of the special 100,000 points medals. However, the multiplier system is also the most difficult to get to grips with and exploit, as it requires a lot of pre-planning on the player's part with regards to stage and boss strategies in order to maximize potential point gains. The multiplier system in essence features an incremental multiplier that is gained by destroying LARGE enemies. You can continue to increment the multiplier up to a max of 64x, via this simple table (the number in brackets refers to the amount of large enemies destroyed to reach that multiplier stage) :[CR]2x (destroy 2)[CR]4x (3)[CR]8x (4)[CR]16x (5)[CR]32x (6)[CR]64x (7 and more)[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Ship Selection : at the ship select screen...[CR]1) To select a 'main shot power type' fighter, select your ship with A button.[CR]2) To select a 'Bomber power type', select your ship with B button.[CR]3) To select a 'Side shot power type', select your ship with C button.[CR]4) To select a 'Speed up type', select your ship with Start button.[CR]* Phase 2 : to unlock 3 more fighter planes, insert a coin and press Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, A, B, Start.[CR]* Phase 3 : to unlock 2 more fighter planes, insert a coin and press Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start (the entering of this code has to be finished before the counter passes 10).[CR]* Special Course : hold C button, insert a coin and press Up, Down, Up, Down Left, Right, Left, Right, B, A, Start and release C button.[CR]* Team Edit : insert a coin and press Up, Down, Up, Down Left, Right, Left, Right, A, B, Start (the entering of this code has to be started after the counter passes 10).[CR]* Stage Edit : start from the game mode selection screen, highlight the game mode of your choice and press A+B simultaneously.[CR]* Score Mode : to show up score calculations, start from anywhere in the game, hold C button and tap Joystick Up (to leave the score mode, re-enter the code).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

Danmaku is a Japanese term for 'barrage', as in a barrage of bullets.[CR]The main source of inspiration for this game has been the game "Gun Frontier" (1990 ,Taito). The main gun and bomb power-up systems are almost identical in mechanics, many vehicles have the same attacking patterns, you can destroy scenery and there are flamingos flying away at stage 2 of both games :). Another interesting thing : "Batsugun" also was a source of inspiration for this game, as the last Toaplan game was one of the first SHMUPS in which bombing in key spots (4th boss) could grant a lot of points.[CR]The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table.

Whenever you die, you get a bonus of 20 SMALL Weapon bullets added to your current stock.[CR]3) Options : there are five basic formations available which are controlled by pressing the "Change Formation" button. They are :[CR]- Spread : two on each side of your ship, one fixed by your side firing at a wideish angle, and one fixed near your ship's nose, firing at a tighter angle. Overall firepower style similar to a fiveway spread.[CR]- Tail : 4 pointing backwards in a wide fan shape, similar to a Silvergun's fully powered Tail shot.[CR]- Front : 4 pointing straight forwards, fixed in front of your ship's nose. Good for concentrated attacks.[CR]- Rotate : 4 Options spaced equally in a ring around your ship, spinning and firing when you do. Pretty useless.[CR]- Trace : similar formation to Front, except they follow your ship around the screen, firing in the opposite direction to your movements. More useful than Rotate Wink[CR]The order in which the Option formations are cycled are as follows. It is important to learn this order, as quick switching of formations is important to survival in many stages :[CR]Spread &gt; Tail &gt; Front &gt; Rotate &gt; Trace &gt; (back to Spread)[CR]There are also secret formations, that are activated when you fulfill certain requirements. These requirements are based on missing a certain number and type of item BEFORE you pick up the next available Option icon, and also remember that it is a lot easier to set up for certain special formations than others:[CR]- Search : these are fixed in a similar formation to Spread, but they track and fire at nearby enemies. It is quite hard to destroy faster moving drones with this formation, so if possible, avoid this and go for Homing instead. To get Search, miss 5 Option items, then pick up the next one that appears.[CR]- Shadow : the Option items trail your ship much like the Gradius Options do. Useful if you like that sort of thing Wink. To get Shadow, miss 5 Medals, then pick up an Option item.[CR]- Homing : the Options have full range of the screen, and will fly right up to the nearest enemy and attack. Very useful Very Happy. To get Homing, miss 5 SMALL Weapon bullets, then pick up an Option item.[CR]- Wide : they are fixed in the same manner as the Spread formation, but have a much wider firing angle. To get Wide, miss 5 SMALL Shot power ups, then pick up an Option item.[CR]- Chain : only available in two-player mode, the Options will create a chain between both ships. More Options beans a bigger chain Very Happy. To get Shadow, one player must satisfy a special formation condition, and the chances of Chain activating is 50%..[CR]There is also a activation order for the special formations which takes effect if you satisfy two or more activation conditions. The order is:[CR]Search &gt; Shadow &gt; Homing &gt; Wide[CR]You can also cancel a special formation by a press of the Option button. Canceling a special form puts you straight back into Spread options.[CR]* Self Destruction : one other unlisted weapon you can use is the explosion and resulting scattered shrapnel released from your ship when it is destroyed. The power of the explosion itself isn't very powerful, but the shrapnel can cause moderate damage to larger enemies. For example, the four large tanks before the Stage 4 boss can have their turrets and tracks destroyed with a well placed suicide, which can set up for easier collection of the LARGE Weapon bullets they hold. The shrapnel released from your ship's explosion also nullifies bullets, so if you find yourself in a tricky situation with a few extra lives in stock, suicide one of them.[CR]* Ship Selection : at the ship select screen...[CR]1) To select a 'Normal power type' fighter, select your ship with A button,[CR]2) To select a 'Speed Up power type', select your ship with B button,[CR]3) To select a 'Shot power type', select your ship with C button,[CR]4) To select a 'Speed up &amp; Shot power type', select your ship with A+B+C button.[CR]* "Mahou Daisakusen" Character : insert a credit, at the title screen press Up(x2), Down(x2), Left, Right, Left, Right, A, B, C, Start.[CR]* Extended Mode : insert a credit, press and hold A and press Start (This code does not work with the type-2 version).[CR]* Harder Mode : insert a credit, press and hold B and press Start (This code does not work with the type-2 version).[CR]* Stage Edit : insert a credit, press and hold C and press Start (This code does not work with the type-2 version).[CR]* Unlock Special mode (combines extended, stage edit and harder modes) : insert a credit, press and hold A+B+C and press Start (this code does not work with the type-2 version).[CR]* Hint : destroy bridges and buildings!! Use your smartbombs to destroy bridges and buildings. They often contain large numbers of score medals.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Battle Garegga (1996)[CR]2.

Reportedly only 100 units ever made and given out as prizes to high score contest winners.[CR]Scitron / Gamest released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (DoDonPachi, ESP Ra.de.

If you shoot where a bee medal is hidden, it starts to blink. Then you will need to use your laser to free it, before you can collect the medal.[CR]* Hits : There is a combo score system for hits within a specific time range. If it takes too long for your next hit, the chain breaks and counting restarts.[CR]* Hidden 1up player : In stage 3 is your one and only chance to pick up a 1up item. It is hidden in the giant red spaceship you will pass later in the stage. To get it, open all 6 side-boxes with your laser, before you destroy the main tower in the center of the ship. You are not allowed to use your smartbomb for these actions. Otherwise the 1up item would not appear in the ruins of the tower afterwards.[CR]* Bomb Stock : If you don't use the smartbombs and keep the stock display at 'maximum' bonus multiplier will be 2x.[CR]* Flower bloom : There are a few places in the game you will meet flowers growing in ruins. If you fly near them they will bloom. This is more than just a joke of the graphic artist. It can reward you with a nice bonus score :[CR](each) flower blooming : 10 points per 1/60 sec.[CR]+ your shots hit it : 510 points per bullet[CR]+ your laser crosses it : 1'100 points per 1/30 sec.[CR]* Second loop : To access the second (harder) loop thus being able to fight against Hibachi, the 'true' final boss after level 6 boss, you have to complete the first 6 levels with only one credit and meet at least one of these conditions :[CR]- Don't lose more than 2 fighters (lives). [CR]- Depending on the fighter, have a maximum hit count of at least : [CR]Type A : 270 hits [CR]Type B : 300 hits [CR]Type C : 330 hits [CR]- At least 50 million points by the end of level 6. [CR]- Collect all 13 bees in four of the 6 areas using the tactic explained above for 'bee medals'.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. DonPachi (1995)[CR]2. DoDonPachi (1997)[CR]3.

Try not to damage the 2nd boss for too much though, if it gets too damaged it won't reveal the core.[CR]* Dragon Blaze characters:[CR]1) Quaid:[CR]- Speed: average.[CR]- Shot Attack: average width and power, powerful aimed secondary lances with every button press. NOTE: Extra lances can be fired with faster button inputs.[CR]- Shot Special - Button Held: aimed narrow stream of fire. Slow moving fireballs that stay on the screen for a few seconds. Good for deploying on one side of the screen to let them do their work while you take care of something else on screen.[CR]- Dragon Attack: average width and call-back speed.[CR]- Dragon Special: wide Dragon breath, very little range, must be positioned close for any real effect.[CR]- Bomb: good, full screen protection for 2 seconds.[CR]2) Sonia:[CR]- Speed: slow.[CR]- Shot Attack: wider shot than Quaid but about the same power, but she has a very strong secondary lazers that can take out multiple weaker enemies in one shot. Excellent.[CR]- Shot Special - Button Held: very wide spead, powerful. Good.[CR]- Dragon Attack: one of the best in the game, if you notice the main dragon has two extra dragons either side of it making it the widest of all the dragon strikes, only down side is the call-back speed is slow.[CR]- Dragon Special: poor and pretty useless. Main Dragon fires a weak green spread while the two smaller dragons home onto the closest enemy with an even weaker attack. Pretty much useless.[CR]- Bomb: poor, deploys a protective barrier slighly wider than Sonia vertical up the screen, can be hit if outside barrier, useful for sticky situations and not much else.[CR]3) Rob:[CR]- Speed: slowest.[CR]- Shot Attack: one of the best in the game, Wide powerful spread covering a large span of the screen. His secondary weapon are very powerful slow moving metal balls tavelling at a slight angle to the sides but has limited range.[CR]- Shot Special - Button Held: powerful spread of rocks, fast and covers a wide area.[CR]- Dragon Attack: about the same range as Quaids but a little stronger, but again as with Sonia the recall speed is slow, not as slow but easily slower than Quaid and Ian.[CR]- Dragon Special: powerful hori laser, decent. Very useful for level 6.[CR]- Bomb: good, full screen protection for 2 seconds.[CR]4) Ian:[CR]- Speed: fastest.[CR]- Shot Attack: straight fire, average. Secondary weapons are homing daggers that ermm, home in. Okay if you're going for survival but a pain in the arse if you're going for score because it kills everything before you get a chance to dragon shot them. Poor for Score, good for survival.[CR]- Shot Special - Button Held: strong powerful laser, good but, Ian's powerbar takes about 10 years to charge so use it wisely[CR]- Dragon Attack: pretty much the same power and width as Quaid, but with the fastest dragon recall in the entire game. Excellent.[CR]- Dragon Special: green round circular area, shield? I dunno what it is but it spins around the spins the dragon Confused . Good for taking out stronger enemies in level stages.[CR]- Bomb: worst in the game, pretty much useless, it does sod all damage. Poor for panic situation too, no invulnerability.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [JP] (Mar. 31, 2005) "Sol Divide &amp; Dragon Blaze [Psikyo Shooting Collection Vol.3] [Model SLPM-62593]"[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Dragon Spirit (c) 1987 Namco.[CR]Dragon Spirit scorches the screen with a mythical fantasy theme hot enough to thrill players throughout the land. Come with us, and journey to a time long ago when prehistoric beings populated the globe. Where after a millennium of captivity, an ugly serpent demon named 'Zawell' escapes imprisonment and kidnaps Alicia, princess to the kingdom of Mitgult. A young, crafty soldier Amul is selected to rescue the princess and destroy Zawell. In praying to the gods for strength and courage, he points his sword high toward the heavens. Suddenly he is transformed into an all-powerful blue dragon, bestowed with special powers. Though gifted with a lethal air and ground attack, this is not enough. He must locate and obtain extra powers along the way. The demon has instructed nine of the mightiest beasts to stop Amul before reaching his goal. Do not underestimate this soldier, he has the Dragon Spirit![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Namco System 1 hardware[CR]Game ID : DS[CR]Main CPU : 6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Sub CPU : 6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : 6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]MCU: HD63701 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.57958 Mhz), Namco advanced 8-channel stereo WSG, stereo DAC[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Dragon Spirit was released in June 1987 in Japan.

[CR]In an otherwise peaceful world, the Shinra Empire began conquering nearby nations one by one to expand their territory gradually. Meanwhile, in the Shinra weapons lab, the Espgaluda project produced two successful prototypes: Agaha and Tateha. Fearing for their future, the project's head scientist, Hiodoshi, escaped with the two prototypes to a nearby kingdom, but time after were found by Shinra's troops and Hiodoshi was killed by the attack of the imperial army, the power of the galuda has awaken. [CR]You have the option of controlling one of two siblings each with different skills, Ageha  faster but with narrower shooting capabilities or Tateha slower but with a wider attack. As you fly through the various stages various mechanical enemies attack with a high number of bullets, often nearly filling the screen. Aside from the regular shots, Ageha and Tateha also have additional abilities which help the player navigate through the numerous bullets. The first is a guard barrier; when activated the player is immune to collisions and as a bonus when the barrier button is released a more powerful laser shot is fired. A meter at the bottom of the screen indicates how much power is left in the barrier. The second ability is called the Kakusei mode; when this mode is activated your character gender is altered and is able to fire a more powerful shot. More importantly, when this mode is activated all of the enemies and their bullets slow down considerably while the players speed remains the same making it easier to navigate through a tricky pattern of bullets. Activating Kakusei mode will rapidly deplete the players supply of green gems; since the number of gems isn't limitless the player may not be able to remain in Kakusei mode for long. When not in Kakusei mode additional gems can be collected by destroying the various enemies. If the player completely runs out of gems, enemy bullets begin travelling faster than usual. Another bonus in the game is gold inguts which greatly increase the players score. These are found when in Kakusei mode; when an enemy is destroyed, all of its bullets will turn into ingots which can be collected by the player.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the IGS PGM (PolyGameMaster) System Hardware.[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 20 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 8.468 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : ICS2115 32 Channel PCM (@ 8.468 Mhz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Vertical[CR]Video Resolution : 448 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 59.17 Hz[CR]Palette Colors : 2304[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Change Sex, [C] Psychic Bomb[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Espgaluda was released on October 15, 2003.[CR]Developed by Cave and distributed by AMI (Amusement Marketing International).[CR]The title of this game literally means 'Butterfly with Extras Sensory Powers'.[CR]Cave released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Espgaluda Original Soundtrack / CVST-0001) on March 15, 2004.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Kakusei mode (Awakening mode) : During the so-called 'kakusei mode' move, bullets slow down and enemy bullets are capable of being transformed formed into massive amounts of gold.

				<plot>Galaga (c) 1981 Namco. [CR]Galaga is a single-screen shoot-em-up in which the player controls a 'Fighter' spaceship and must defend the home planet against the on-coming hordes of alien invaders called "Galagans". The Fighter can only move left and right along the bottom of the screen. [CR]Galagans fly onto the screen in a variety of formations before forming troop lines at the top of the screen. Once all troop lines are formed the Galagans separate and start attacking the player's Fighter in ones, twos and threes. The top-line Boss Galaga need to be shot twice before they are destroyed. [CR]The Boss Galaga has a tractor beam that can capture the player's Fighter. A captured Fighter changes color from white to red and stays with that particular Boss until it is destroyed. The Fighter can be retrieved by destroying the Boss that captured it, but players must be careful not to destroy the captured Fighter itself, or that Fighter is lost. A rescued Fighter changes color back to white and links up with the player's current Fighter, doubling its fire power. [CR]As players progress through each screen, the speed and number of alien attacks increases. Alien formations also become more complex, making the aliens harder to shoot. [CR]Bonus Fighters are awarded periodically throughout the game, as players reach specific point values, as dictated by the 'Bonus Life' dip switch setting. Each enemy ship also has an assigned point value (see Scoring below). [CR]The alien troop lines that form at the top of the screen are, from top to bottom: Boss Galaga (in one row of four), Butterflies (red/white bug ships, in two rows of eight, directly below the Boss Galaga), and Bees (blue/yellow bug ships, in two rows of ten, directly below the Butterflies). [CR]In Stage 1, the enemies do not drop bombs as they fly onto the screen. However, they do so in most of the later stages. [CR]From Stage 4 onwards, a squadron of special bonus enemies called "transforms" start appearing. They're called transforms because Bees will begin pulsating and move out of formation to change into these bonus enemies. They appear in the form of yellow scorpions in Stages 4, 5, and 6, green 'Spy Ships' from "Bosconian" in Stages 8, 9, and 10, and Galaxian Flagships in Stages 12, 13, and 14. After that, the three different transforms are repeated in the same order. Transforms are always worthwhile targets because they are not very aggressive and are worth more than the other enemies. If all three transforms are destroyed, extra bonus points will be awarded. [CR]Galaga also features CHALLENGING STAGES, these consist of 40 Galagans that fly onto the screen in formations but do not drop any bombs. The object is to shoot as many of them as possible before they leave the play area. When an entire formation of eight Galagans is destroyed, bonus points are added to the player's score. If all 40 aliens are destroyed, players are awarded a special bonus of 10,000 points. [CR]Two new gameplay features Galaga introduced are : [CR]1) Players are given the chance to double their fire power. [CR]2) The game has a rapid fire (automatic firing) option, whereby the player simply holds the FIRE button down and the space fighter continues to fire at the Galagan army in bursts of two missiles each.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR][Upright model][CR]Game ID : GG[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (x3), MB88xx[CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG, discrete circuitry (for the ship explosion sound)[CR]Palette colors : 32 (16 colors for tiles + 16 colors for sprites)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Galaga was released in September 1981 in Japan.[CR]Although Galaga was a superior game, it didn't sell the large numbers that "Galaxian" did. One of the first games with a bonus stage. [CR]The game 'rolls over' at 999,990 points. The 1P score counter is six digits, but the 2P counter is seven digits. Therefore, most good players start a 2-player game and play exclusively on the 2P side so their score won't 'roll over' at 999,990. After the 1,000,000 mark, new Fighters are no longer awarded. [CR]What happens after finishing Stage 255 depends upon the skill level set in the DIP switches: [CR]* On the easy skill, the game resets. [CR]* On the medium skill, the game flips to "Stage 0" which plays as a strange cross between the 2nd Challenging Stage and a regular level where the enemies shoot. The game will advance to Stage 1 after completion, and the game will get easy again. [CR]* On the hard skill setting, the words "Stage 0" stay on the screen forever. No more enemies ever appear. The player can continue to move the ship and fire, but there is no way to advance to the next level, or to die. To play again, the machine must be reset. [CR]* On the hardest skill, the game flips to "Stage 0" which plays like Stage 1 (no extra enemies when flying onto the screen), but it is still as difficult as Stage 255. The game will advance to Stage 1 after completion, and the game will get easy again. [CR]If you have more than seven extra Fighters, the marker for the screen will only show 7 1/2 (!) Fighters remaining. Additional extra Fighters will still be credited, even though they won't show on the screen. [CR]In Japan, the Bees are referred to as 'Zako' and the Butterflies are referred to as 'Goei'. [CR]Stephen Krogman holds the official record for this game with 15,999,990 points. [CR]A Galaga unit appears in the 1983 movie 'WarGames', the 1983 movie 'Spring Break' (being played by one of the main characters), the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid,' the 1987 movie 'Planes, Trains and Automobiles', and the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men', Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes), and was shown in 2012 movie 'The Avengers' (a agent soldier was surprised playing in the Helicarrier computer).[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Bee : 50 points in formation or 100 points in flight.[CR]Butterfly : 80 points in formation or 160 points in flight.[CR]Boss Galaga : 150 points in formation or 400 points in flight.[CR]Boss Galaga : 800 points in flight with 1 wingman.[CR]Boss Galaga : 1,600 points in flight with 2 wingmen.[CR]Scorpions : 160 points each, 1,000 points for destroying all 3.[CR]Bosconian Spy Ships : 160 points each, 2,000 points for destroying all 3.[CR]Galaxian Flagships : 160 points each, 3,000 points for destroying all 3.[CR]Captured fighter : 500 points in formation or 1000 points in flight.[CR]Challenging Stage : 100 points per ship destroyed if less than 40.[CR]Challenging Stage : 10,000 points for destroying all 40 ships (Perfect).[CR]Challenging Stage : 1,000 points on the first two Challenging Stages, 1,500 points on the 3rd and 4th, 2,000 points on the 5th and 6th, and 3,000 points from the 7th onward for destroying a complete formation of 8 ships.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Enemy Stop Shooting : on the first stage, kill everything but the two Bees in the bottom left corner. Then just wait, dodging the enemies' shots, until the enemy no longer drops any shots towards you. After the enemies stop firing, let them pass for two more trips and then kill them. For the rest of the game, the enemies will not drop shots. It will take approximately 15 minutes for the enemies to quit shooting at you, so this trick requires a lot of patience. Note : in a 2-player game, only one person has to do the cheat for both players to benefit. But as soon as one of the player's game is over the enemies begin shooting again.[CR]* (BUG) Take The Control Of The Fighter For Free : during the Galaga demo, the Boss Galaga comes down and tries to tractor-beam the Fighter. As soon as that tractor-beam starts, the player can take control of the ship in the demo. The player has two choices here and this will effect how the game handles this bug : If the player allows himself to be captured, the demo will continue as normal and he has the option of controlling the player Fighter or not. The player can choose whether to save the captured Fighter, try to complete the level, etc. The demo mode will complete after 30 seconds and the high-score screen will appear. If the player takes control of the Fighter and destroys the Boss Galaga with the tractor beam, some of the characters on the screen will freeze while others are still moving and doing what they are suppose to be doing. This will last 15-20 seconds, then the game will go to the high score screen.[CR]* Challenging stages are easier if the high score numbers are used to refine your aim. These tips assume a 6-digit high score :[CR]1) On the first two challenging stages, aim your ships so that your left set of bullets falls between the second and third numbers in the high score list.[CR]2) On subsequent challenging stages, aim one set of your bullets between the first and second numbers in the high score list (if the units come from the left) or between the last and next-to-last numbers (if the units come from the right). This will allow you to hit descending enemies at the highest possible point.[CR]* Here is a neat (and useless) Galaga trick : It is possible to end the game with a 200% ratio. The 200% hit-miss ratio trick can only be done with your first shot of the game. When the game starts, don't move, and fire only one shot. If you time it correctly, two enemies will be killed at once. Let your remaining Fighters be destroyed, and presto : a better-than-perfect result.[CR]* Easter Egg :[CR]1) Enter service mode.[CR]2) Keep B1 pressed and enter the following sequence : Right(x5), Left(x6), Right(x3), Left(x7).

				<plot>Galaga '88 (c) 1987 Namco.[CR]Galaga '88 is an updated version of the old favorite, "Galaga", with more invaders and more player firepower. Galaga '88 gives players a chance to once again repel the invaders from the Galagan Kingdom. One or two players can try their hand at fighting the invaders. This time the Galagans have four more allies, each with unique weapons and defenses that a player must overcome. [CR]By destroying special enemies or obstacles the player can get 'items'. When a player has two items, they can warp to another dimension to confront more Galagan ships with new strategies. In the Challenging Stages (labelled in this game as 'That's Galactic Dancin'), the player shoots down as many invaders as possible as the Galagans dance to a waltz, tango, march or jazz tune. [CR]The player selects single or dual ship power. The objective is to destroy all the Galagan foes in each of the 29 sectors of the galaxy, with each sector more difficult than the last. [CR]Unique Features : [CR]* More opponents. In addition to Boss, Goei and Zako, the original Galagan crew, Don, Nin, Ban, and Gan have been added. Each of the Galagans has a unique way of challenging the players. [CR]* Different types of ships. Players can choose single or dual ships (if the game option is set for dual and single). When the player retrieves a dual ship from the Boss's tractor beam, it turns into a triple ship with ten times the power of a single ship. [CR]* Challenging Stages. In the 'That's Galactic Dancin' stages, the Galagan invaders dance to a waltz, tango, Sousa march or jazz tune, while the player shoots down Galagans to earn bonus points. [CR]* Warping to a new dimension. By destroying particular enemies or obstacles and capturing two of their items, the player can warp to the next dimension. [CR]* Player challenge. Each dimension has different mix of Galagans with different strategies to be overcome. [CR]* Win back captured ships. The player can win back ships captured in the Boss Galaga's tractor beam. When the player destroys the Boss, the ships are released. If the player retrieves them, the ships become dual ships if they were single and triple if they were dual. [CR]* High Score Mode. Upon completing a game, a player can enter his initials if they are among the top eight scorers on the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]This title was usually sold as a conversion kit (most games were back in 1988). It used the standard JAMMA harness. The marquee showed a gold 'Galaga '88' logo on a field of red teardrops. The side-art had the same picture as the marquee, but without the background. The control panel featured a single 2-way joystick and a 'FIRE' button on either side (along with Start buttons and game instructions). Many of these machines will have 8-way joysticks instead of the original 2-way ones, they are interchangeable as far as this game is concerned.

[CR]An homage to "Bosconian" is paid in stages 15-17 (Dimension 4) with the green hexagonal space stations in the background, as well as the mines which are used as scenery objects. [CR]Challenging Stage 2 from Dimension 1 is used as a loading game in "Ridge Racer Revolution" for the original Sony PlayStation. [CR]Stephen Krogman holds the official record for this game with 1,575,490 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Perfect Bonus : Shoot all 40 enemies in the 'That's Galactic Dancin' bonus stages to receive a 'Perfect' bonus just like in the Challenging Stages in the original "Galaga". Initially this bonus is 10,000 points but it increases on later 'That's Galactic Dancin' stages. [CR]* Secret Bonus : during the 'That's Galactic Dancin' bonus stages, don't touch anything : don't shoot and don't move (simply don't touch the joystick); at the end of the dance and after getting ZERO hits and ZERO points, you'll receive a 10,000 points 'Secret Bonus'. [CR]* Pick up two blue items to get a bonus and go to the next harder dimension after completing a 'That's Galactic Dancin' stage. This bonus is also initially 10,000 points but increases each time you achieve it. [CR]* Pick up a purple item which appears on later stages to immediately get a triple-firepower ship.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Galaxian (1979)[CR]2. Galaga (1981)[CR]3.

Sorcerers in eastern Japan would predict the day's fishing catch by the appearance of a fox-like voice from the mountains. If the voice sounded 'koon koon' then there was to be a great catch. If the voice sounded 'gwange gwange' then it was to be a horrible catch. The people soon named the place of the voice 'Prison-Gate Mountain', as all who saw the origin of this voice were never seen again. The people soon began to worship this being as the god of Prison-Gate Mountain. It is said that the men later came to call it 'Lord Guwange'. The game title of 'Guwange' appears to reflect the name of this mysterious mountain voice and also the 'bad' sound that it made to predict a horrible catch.[CR]This game was supposed to be exported to South Korea. But Korean deliberation Organization rejected this game, because it has strong Japanese things (Korean people are really anti-Japanese).[CR]Soundtrack releases :[CR]Guwange / ESPrade Original Soundtrack [Cave - CVST-1000 - Dec 30, 2007][CR]GUWANGE Arrange Album + Original Soundtrack [Cave - CVAS-004] (2010-02-20)[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]* Game Clear Bonus : upon clearance, the game rewards you for the following : full life segments remaining, maximum chain count, bombs remaining, and never receiving damage ('no miss').[CR]1) Life bonus : if you have any full life segments remaining (denoted as L), this bonus is calculated by the following formula :[CR]9,216 / (4 - L) / 32 * 10,000. If you have all three life segments remaining, but you were hit at least once, then this value is multiplied by 2. If you were never hit, then this value is multiplied by 4.

				<plot>Gyruss (c) 1983 Konami Industry Company, Limited.[CR]Gyruss is a single player shoot-em-up in which the purpose is to fly through the solar system, destroying waves of alien attackers, before finally reaching Earth. Planets that must be passed before Earth is reached are Neptune, Uranus, Saturn, Jupiter, and Mars. [CR]It only takes two warps to reach Neptune, but all of the others, including Earth, take three warps to get to. Each time the player reaches a planet, they will be faced with a 'Chance Stage', a bonus stage in which players try to destroy as many aliens as possible to accrue points. After reaching Earth, there is a Chance Stage, followed by a very fast '3 Warps to Neptune' stage. After this, the levels and the background music start over. [CR]Gyruss' superb gameplay, in which the player ship rotates around the edges of the screen and fires 'inwards', is heavily influenced by Atari's 1981 classic, "Tempest". While the design of the alien ships themselves is similar to those of Namco's also-legendary "Galaga" series.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX347[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz), M6809 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), I8039 (@ 533.333 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : (5x) AY8910 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), DAC, (6x) RC (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2 (alternative)[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 1[CR]=&gt; Fire[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Gyruss was released in March 1983. Also licensed to Centuri for US manufacture and distribution (April 1983). [CR]After working on the successful "Time Pilot", Gyruss' designer, Yoshiki Okamoto, went on to create Gyruss, which, although a success in its own right, was released at a time when the arcade craze was starting to die down. This may explain why the game didn't shift the units it really deserved. After its release, Okamoto asked for a raise, or he would quit. He was duly fired when he turned up for work the following day. [CR]One of the most memorable features of this game is its soundtrack, which consists of an extremely catchy synthesized rendition of Bach's 'Tocatta and Fugue in D Minor'. [CR]Anthony Fodrizio holds the official record for this game with 41090450 points. [CR]A set of developer credits are hidden in the ROM, beginning at 1E9A in memory.[CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "Venus". [CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-85) on June 25, 1986.[CR]A Gyruss unit appears in the music video for "Kid Candy" by the grunge rock group Seaweed.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Shooting a ship : 50, 100 or 150 points. [CR]Destroying a whole formation of enemy ships before the next wave attacks : 1000, 1500, 2000, 2500 points. [CR]Bonus for clearing a sector (having not destroyed a whole formation) : 1000 points. [CR]Shooting the three glowing spheres : 1000, 1500, 2000 points. [CR]Bonus for shooting each ship on the Chance Stage : 100 points. [CR]Bonus for shooting all 40 ships on the Chance Stage : 10000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* You can get double fire if you shoot the sun-like enemy that appears in front of you surrounded by two blue pod-like enemies - try to make this a priority.[CR]* To make getting double fire easier, try to stay at the bottom of the screen until the 'pod and sun' formation appears as it will appear right in front of wherever your ship is after all enemies have entered and they start attacking. [CR]1) There must be at least three enemies left in the level for the 'pod and sun' formation to show. If you lose a life and three enemies are left, the 'pod and sun' will show up one more time, but if you lose a life after that, they will not show any more until the next level. After you get double fire, the sun enemy will be replaced on later levels with another pod. Destroy all three for some bonus points.[CR]2) If you have only one enemy left and cannot seem to destroy it, just leave it alone and eventually it will just leave and the level will end.[CR]* Each level begins with four formations entering. If you destroy enough of these, a fifth formation will enter. As you pass each planet, more formations will enter towards the top of the screen. Learn to control your ship at the top as it will come in real handy on those Mars and Earth warps.[CR]* When formations enter from the edge of the screen, they will not hit you if you are right where they enter. You can use this to your advantage to take out the formation with little or no trouble - just watch out for asteroids.[CR]* Asteroids will always appear in your path - they cannot be destroyed and must be avoided.[CR]* The 'bee-like' creatures with the force field will always appear from the center and move outward. The force field will destroy your ship if you touch it. Destroy one of the creatures to disable their force field.[CR]* Learn the formations of the enemy attack waves during the normal stages, to enable you to collect the bonuses for destroying whole waves of attacking ships.[CR]* Learn the formations of the enemy attack waves during the chance stages, to enable you to collect the bonuses for destroying whole waves of attackers and the 10,000 for destroying all 40 ships.[CR]* The three glowing spheres always appear aligned with where you are located on screen. Remember to avoid any bullets when they appear.[CR]* You can fire bullets ahead of enemy ships and then move aside to destroy them and avoid their shots.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Programmer: Toshio Arima[CR]Designer: Yoshiki Okamoto[CR]Character: Hideki Ooyami[CR]Sound: Masahiro Inoue[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Colecovision [US] (1984) "Gyruss [Model 9980]" [CR]Atari 2600 [US] (1984) "Gyruss [Model PB5080]" [CR]Atari 5200 [US] (1984) "Gyruss [Model 9080]" [CR]Atari XEGS [CR]Nintendo NES [US] (1988) "Gyruss [Model NES-YS-USA]" [CR]Nintendo NES [EU] (1988) [CR]Nintendo Famicom Disk [JP] (November 18, 1988) "Gyruss [Model KDS-GRS]" [CR]Sony PlayStation [JP] (May 13, 1999) "Konami 80's Arcade Gallery [Model SLPM-86228]" [CR]Sony PlayStation [US] (November 30, 1999) "Konami Arcade Classics [Model SLUS-00945]" [CR]Nintendo Game Boy Advance [US] (March 21, 2002) "Konami Collectors Series: Arcade Advanced [Model AGB-AKCE-USA]" [CR]Nintendo Game Boy Advance [JP] (May 2, 2002) "Konami Arcade Game Collection [Model AGB-AKCJ-JPN]" : Re-released as a "Konami the Best" edition (November 3, 2005) [CR]Nintendo Game Boy Advance [EU] (June 21, 2002) "Konami Collectors Series: Arcade Classics [Model AGB-AKCP-EUR]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [XBLA] [JP] [US] [EU] (April 18, 2007) [CR]* Computers : [CR]Atari 800 [US] (1984) "Gyruss [Model 1280]" [CR]Commodore C64 [EU] (1984) [CR]Commodore C64 [US] (1984) "Gyruss [Model PB1780]" [CR]* Others : [CR]Arcade [US] [EU] [AU] [KO] (November 1998) "Konami 80's AC Special" [CR]Arcade [JP] (November 1998) "Konami 80's Arcade Gallery" [CR]Mobile Phones [JP] (2004) [CR]Konami Arcade Advanced Plug 'n Play TV Game [US] (2004) by Majesco[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Ketsui - Kizuna Jigoku-tachi (c) 2003 Cave.[CR]The continuous industrialization that started in 1900, finally led to unavoidable consequences in the middle of the 21st century. The waterlevel rose worldwide and threatened many coastal countries. So the shorelines had to be modified In order to save the human civilization from drowning. It was a time of great confusion about the future, and nobody thought about war. Well, almost... There was one company called EVAC corporation, who made a great profit from underhand productions and exports of weapon systems. When the United Nations discovered their illegal trades, they pointed EVAC to the global ban of weapon imports and exports, and asked them to stop their productions and to destroy their weapon facilities immediately. EVAC rejected all accusations and refused to take any actions. So a preventive war was started by the United Nations to stop the EVAC corporation.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]IGS PGM hardware[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 20 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 8.468 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : ICS2115 (@ 8.468 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; [A] Fire, [B] Bomb, [C] Autofire[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Ketsui was released in January 2003.[CR]Developed/Produced by Cave and Sales by AMI (Amusement Marketing International).[CR]Cave released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Dodonpachi Dai-Ou-Jou / Ke-Tsu-I - Kizunajigokutachi - Original Sound Track - CVST-0000) on 06/06/2003.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* High Scoring : The key to high scoring is moving up close (VERY close) to your enemies and blasting them for point boxes labeled 1 through 5 (Five is worth the most, of course).[CR]* Lock-Shot Properties: With Lock-Shot active your helicopter will move slower. You start with 2 pods, one on each side of the helicopter. each can lock onto a target. After powering up twice you will gain 2 more pods (total of 4) and have the ability to lock onto four separate targets. Usually you just have all pods lock onto one target for max damage. You do NOT do more damage closer to enemies. However, when closer, you lock on faster, and less enemies will be in the way of your pods and the target, so you will end up dealing more. Your Helicopter will shoot a beam out in front. It CANNOT reach full screen! You will see it end at about 3/4 from the bottom. The Beam DOES do damage, albeit very little, but it can add up. Lock-Shot will lock onto enemies quicker the closer you are. It will not let go until you release A or the target is destroyed. During Boss Battles, it is quicker to hold C, wait just until the Boss can be damaged, then hold down A. You have to be close for this. Enemies will drop more Chips when Lock-Shot mode is active. You must get in the habit of keeping Lock-Shot HELD DOWN even after an enemy is destroyed, because there are several that will continue to drop boxes even after death or explode multiple times.[CR]* The Score Bar:[CR]- 1st Row: Multiplier Overall Counter. Multiplier used in [after] the boss fight. It's the total sum of all chips gathered up until the boss fight. Unless you die, it will not deplete until the boss fight.[CR]- 2nd Row: Multiplier Counter (1-999). [CR]Multiplier used in stage. Grows as you gather Multiplier Chips, but depletes as you use your lock shot, and if you die.[CR]- Multiplier Chip Rate: The type of chip you get when you kill enemies with the lock shot. When the Multiplier timer reaches 0, it'll be reset when you kill an enemy with your normal shot, and is valid until the timer reaches 0.[CR]- 3rd Row: Current chip NUMBER (1-5). Measures the time the chip rate is valid. Will rise as you kill enemies with the shot or lock shot, but the chip rate will return to 1 when the timer hits zero. The multiplier is raised as you gather multiplier chips. Basically you need to remember that killing an enemy at close distance produces are larger chip. Conversely, what depletes the multiplier is destroying enemies with the lock shot. Depending on the type of enemy, they can take off up to 1/30 to 1/10 of the entire value (popcorn enemies deplete it by a small amount, whereas bosses deplete it by a large one). If you die, it will decrease by 1/4.[CR]- Characteristics of the multiplier at the boss fight: Unlike points 1 and 2, during the boss fight, the value of the overall multiplier counter is applied straight up. However, there's few chances to raise it during the boss fight, and it will quickly deplete as time passes. Certain bosses are better to ignore their parts and just kill quickly.[CR]* End of Level Bonus = TOTAL CHIPS AQUIRED x (LIVES x 500 points + BOMBS X 50 points)[CR]* Boss form change timing: you want your bullets from Shot to destroy the boss, but be able to get into Lock-Shot mode. I get the bosses life bar just a bit before the form change. You must get the feel.[CR]These are for 1P.[CR]&gt; 1st Boss: between N and S of INSERT COIN[CR]&gt; 2nd Boss: between S and E of INSERT COIN[CR]&gt; 3rd Boss : the 1P score in the middle of the 100s place[CR]&gt; 4th Boss: First Form: Between N and S of INSERT COIN. Second Form: The 1P score between 1000 and 100.[CR]&gt; 5th Boss: First Form: There is no marking to indicate, if you constantly damage him with Lock-Shot, it is when he returns to his first pattern. Second Form: The 1P score at about 10,000. I don't look at this, it is during the second time of his final attack.[CR]* Loops requirements:[CR]- NORMAL "TSUUJOU" LOOP - Total DEATHS + BOMBS =&gt; 6[CR]&gt; Instead of releasing chips, enemies release Suicide bullets.[CR]&gt; Suicide Bullets are PINK.[CR]&gt; Chip Number is ALWAYS 1.[CR]&gt; You can stop suicide bullets from being released (seal) by being within a certain radius of enemies.[CR]&gt; If suicide bullets are sealed, then no chips are gained.[CR]&gt; Difficulty is drastically increased.[CR]- SPECIAL "URA" LOOP (AKA REVERSE LOOP/SIDE) - NO MISS/NO BOMBS, 120+ Million Score[CR]&gt; A text message is given "WELCOME TO THE SPECIAL ROUND" before starting.[CR]&gt; Suicide bullets are BLUE.[CR]&gt; There is a greater number of suicide bullets and they are quicker.[CR]&gt; The distance which you can seal suicide bullets is decreased.[CR]&gt; When suicide bullets are sealed, the number that was due to be discharged will be added to your multiplier (I will figure it out exactly as I get there)[CR]&gt; The rate of decrease when an enemy is destroyed with lock-shot is decreased.[CR]&gt; During Boss Battles, the reduction speed of the Total Multiplier Overall Counter is slowed.[CR]&gt; End of round bonus DOUBLES.[CR]&gt; During the 5th Boss, after the second form is destroyed, DOOM will appear.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Super Spacefortress Macross (c) 1992 Banpresto.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM2203 (@ 1.5 Mhz), (2x) OKI6295 (@ 24.242 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in September 1992 in Japan.[CR]This game is known in Japan as "Chou-zikuu Yousai Macross" (translates from Japanese as 'Super Space Fortress Macross').[CR]Superdimensional Fortress Macross was created as a filler show. Studio Nue was building up to make a series called Superdimensional Cavalry Southern Cross, but they released Macross first. It proved to be their biggest hit, so popular that they extended it from 24 to 35 episodes. They followed up with Superdimensional Century Orguss, which didn't do quite as well, but was still popular enough to spawn a six OVA sequel (Orguss II) in the early 90s. Ironicly, Southern Cross did poorly and was cancelled after only 23 episodes.[CR]Macross, however, has become a major anime staple. After the original series in 1982, there was a movie released in 1984 called 'Do You Remember Love?' This game is based on that movie. Later came a music special, 'Macross Flashback 2012', and then came 'Macross II' (see the history entry for "Super Spacefortress Macross II" for more details), 'Macross Plus' (1994, four OVAs and one movie), 'Macross 7' (1993, 49 TV episodes, 2 OVAs one movie), and 'Macross 7 Dynamite' (4 OVAs).[CR]The Macross movie was written in such a way that somebody could understand it without having seen any of the TV series. As such, a lot of events had to be changed, often quite a bit. As such, Studio Nue considered it to be an alternate timeline from the original series. In the first episode of 'Macross 7', it is established the DYRL was a movie made within the official Macross continuity.[CR]A number of leftover Valkyrie toys were later converted into Transformers toys on AUTOBOT named Jetfire. Because they were forbidden to use a Valkyrie in the Transformers TV show, the animated version was redesigned and renamed 'Skyfire'. The only time an animated version of Jetfire appeared was in the commercial for the Jetfire toy.[CR]Macross is also known worldwide as the first saga of Robotech (the other two sagas adapted are 'Southern Cross' and 'Genesis Climber Mospeada').[CR]Default highscore table (TODAY's BEST SCORE) :[CR]1 3210 1 HIKARU[CR]2 2940 1 MAGS[CR]3 2390 1 MINMAY[CR]4 2020 1 MISA[CR]5 1780 1 FOCKER[CR]6 1130 1 CLODIA[CR]7 1070 1 KAKIZAKI[CR]8 850 1 BRITAI[CR]9 380 1 MIRIA[CR]10 170 1 BODDLEZE[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Moon Cresta (c) 1980 Nichibutsu.[CR]MOON CRESTA is a 1 or 2-player game in which players may compete for highest score against the game computer. Each time a player is hit by an alien, the game switches to his opponent's sequence.[CR]The object is to destroy as many of the descending aliens as possible. To accomplish this the player is given a three stage multi-fire Warship. He begins with the first stage, firing a single laser at the enemy. If he is successful in eliminating the first 4 sets of aliens, he is given an opportunity to dock his first stage onto the second within a specific time limit (the sooner he unites the stages, the higher is his awarded score).[CR]Once docked, the stages combine their firing power, so the first (1 laser) adds to the second (2 lasers) giving the player a total of 3 usable lasers as the game continues.[CR]The player then must face 2 more sets of aliens and a shower of meteors, after which he has a chance to dock again, this time uniting with the third stage for a combined fire power of five lasers. If he is able to defeat the last two sets of aliens intact, the entire sequence begins again. The game continues with increasing difficulty until the entire warship is destroyed. When the warship is hit the player continues with whatever stages remain. If his score reaches 30,000 he is awarded a free game and his score continues to accumulate.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Model MCA-5001 (Upright)[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Tone generator &amp; discrete circuits[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-way joystick (RIGHT and LEFT)[CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE/THRUST)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Moon Cresta was released in July 1980.[CR]Marcus McHaffie holds the official record for this game with 153,490 points.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is relatively simple. Each alien (except meteors and arrows) come in two different colors for each screen.[CR]Eyes (Break in half) : 50 points[CR]Eyes (Destroy other half) : 100 points[CR]Flies : 30 points[CR]Birds : 60 points[CR]Fireballs : 200 points[CR]Arrow Ships : 100 points[CR]Docking is a big way to increase your score. You get the time remaining from 30 seconds multiplied by 100 for your docking bonus.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, all three stages of your ship will come from the bottom of the screen. After going halfway up, the ship on top separates from the other 2 and it settles onto the bottom of the screen ready for battle.[CR]* Remember, you can only keep one set of shots in the 'air' at one time. This means you need to plan your shots out so you don't end up with a lot of misses when the aliens decided to come after your ship.[CR]* In the later screens, the aliens start moving much quicker and you have to be on your toes to keep up with them and avoid being taken out.[CR]* Although the aliens do not fire, they still can cause a lot of hate and discontent by their wild maneuvering. There is no real safe place on the screen from the aliens since they go into the lower corners of the screen, reappear from the bottom after they have apparently 'left' the screen, or just appear right above your ship.[CR]* In the earlier waves, you have to split apart 2 eyes before the rest automatically split and come after your ship. In the later screens, the eyes automatically split upon entering the screen. That means eight instead of four aliens you have to deal with.[CR]* If you manage to dock all three ships together, you will have a lot of firepower (5 shots at once) to send out. Here are some ways, unfortunately, you can lose ships and what ships are lost :[CR]1) Besides the aliens, docking is the second way people lose a lot of ships. The only ship destroyed is the ship attempting to dock.[CR]2) If an alien hits any part of your ships (if all stages are joined), only the stage hit is lost. This can create an amusing circumstance if you lose stage II and you only have stages I and III to fight with.[CR]* Don't worry if you lose Stage I early in the game. One has to be very skilled to fight four screens with Stage I. Stage II is the best stage to fight with. It is a small target plus it has enough firepower to defend itself. Stage III on the other hand, is just a lumbering junkyard. The lasers are too spread out to do much good plus there is a very wide-open area in the middle for aliens to hit.[CR]* The bird stages present the most challenge of the aliens. They appear and disappear at will. Sometimes they will appear right next to your ship so on these stages, be extra alert. If you see one disappear and don't hear the familiar bird chirp of it reappearing, assume it is on the screen somewhere still.[CR]* The best place to 'hide' during the fireball stage is in the lower right corner. The fireballs will not hit your ship in this corner. You can do hit and runs by moving your ship out, shooting at a fireball, then going back to the corner again.[CR]* During the arrow screen, the aliens will hover around the top, then turn into arrows and attempt to ram your ship. In the later screens, they won't even hover but just try to ram your ship.[CR]* Your goal is to make it to 30,000 points so you can have a fresh ship waiting in case you lose all the stages of your present ship.[CR]* Docking isn't that hard to do. After finishing off a wave just before the docking stage, try to center your ship on the screen. That way, all you have to do is move that ship left or right to successfully dock. You want to avoid using the thrusters unless your ship is in extreme peril. The docking bonus can be the most amount of points you score in the game. If you happen to miss a dock, then you will continue the next set of screens with the ship that failed to dock.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Moon Cresta (1980)[CR]2. Terra Cresta (1985)[CR]3.

				<plot>Raiden Fighters Jet (c) 1998 Seibu Kaihatsu.[CR]The third in the Raiden Fighters series. This opus retains the same intensity and manic gameplay as its predecessors, while introducing several new mechanics. The game contains Normal, Special, and Expert game modes.[CR]The soundtrack consists of fast-paced rave and techno music in a departure from the more melodic pop orientated style of the original Raiden game series.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Seibu SPI Hardware[CR]Main CPU : I386 (@ 25 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 7.15909 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YMF271 (@ 7.15909 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [A] FIRE, [B] BOMB[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Raiden Fighters Jet was released in August 1998.[CR]In Greek mythology, Ixion was king of the Lapiths, the most ancient tribe of Thessaly, and a son of Ares or Antion or the notorious evildoer Phlegyas. Raiden Fighters Jet pays homage to a boss from "Raiden II" and recycles several bosses from previous games in the series.[CR]Level 01's boss is a machine that resembles the twin walkers bosses in Stage 1 of "Raiden II". The Raiden Fighters Jet machine has 4 legs as well, but are completely immobile and act as struts for swiveling treads that provide the machine locomotion.[CR]Level 10's boss is the flying boat in the Train Yard stage of the original "Raiden Fighters".[CR]Level 20's boss is similar to the forest stage giant tank boss from the first "Raiden fighters".[CR]Hummingbird XB-3, the boss of the Bomber Squadron stage in "Raiden Fighters 2", makes an appearance in Level 35 as a mid-boss.[CR]Level 35's final boss is the gigantic flying fortress from the end of Mission 2 in the original "Raiden Fighters".[CR]Level 50's first mid-boss in the giant hover tank from the second stage of "Raiden fighters 2".[CR]Level 50's second mid-boss is the giant tank boss from the Forest Stage of the first "Raiden Fighters".[CR]Level 50's final boss is Red Eye, the true final boss from "Raiden Fighters 2". However it says B-7 instead of XB-7, suggesting it is the production model of the Red Eye in "Raiden Fighters 2".[CR]Phase 1's boss is based on the helicopter boss from the first "Raiden Fighters" with a more difficult attack pattern.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]A '2000' version was released in 2000 and runs on cheaper hardware with inferior sound.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Secret Characters : In title screen after inserted a credit, hold BOMB button then press START Button. You can select 'Slave' or 'Fairy' in character selection screen.[CR]* Special Mode : In test mode, turn 'Special Mode' item ON. You can select Normal or Special game mode before character selection screen.[CR]* Hidden Miclus / Fairy locations : Scattered throughout the game are hidden 'Miclus' icons, which will dispense many medals when shot. In order to make a Miclus appear, hover over the following spots with minimal movement until the Miclus crawls out from under that spot, where it can then be shot.[CR]Also, there are hidden Fairy objects, which will appear after certain conditions are met. Grab them for points, but beware as they can be killed if shot.[CR]Miclus locations are as follows :[CR]Level 5 : There are a total of 3 Micluses in this level. There are 3 large, circular cannon-turrets throughout the level. Hover over each turret.[CR]Level 15 : Hover over the small, circular bush, which is about the size of your plane. It's on the left side of the screen after crossing the watery area.[CR]Fairy locations are as follows :[CR]Level 5 : Near the end of the level, there is a large, silver, metal object in the middle of the screen running vertically along the railroad tracks. The top of the object is a suspended metal bar that runs from left to right. Hover above the left side of the bar, then fly back and forth in a straight line from one end of the bar to the other. It should blow up, revealing many Fairies.[CR]Level 15 : From the beginning of the level, get a 'Quick Shot!' bonus on every medium-sized plane that you see by destroying them before they have a chance to fire. A Fairy will appear.[CR]Level 15 : Before the boss appears, do not shoot any small tanks. Two small tanks will drive into the boss's path, where they will be run over to reveal two Fairies.[CR]* Get over 30,000,000 points before the level 40 mission to reach the real last stages of the game.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

The countless super minimum machine group 'nano-machine', which came flying, invaded the principal weapon and military terminals of each country from outer space and began multiplication. This weapon group which is automated with the 'nano-machines' repeated  attack with non discrimination and the metropoles of each country were in a devastating state. A fear of the extensive nuclear warfare with the strategy nuclear missile error morphism hit the world!!! Barely the unit of each country which prevents the invasion of the 'nano- machine' is summoned because of the unmanned weapon eradication  maneuvers. So, fighting with the weapons of the entire world was not enough. The Strikers start the attack on the enemy center!

When the player airplane gets close to it at a fixed distance, it turns red. It is possible to defeat the boss quickly by attacking intensively the core at that point in time. The Technical Bonus is added if you destroy the core.[CR]* Super Shot : when an enemy plane is shot the energy accumulates in the level gauge. When there's enough energy accumulated in the level gauge the super shot can be discharged by pressing continously the shot button. While the super shot is discharging the energy of the level gauge keeps decreasing. When energy becomes 0 the super shot stops being able to shoot. In Strikers 1945 III a cancellation function was attached to the super shot so the energy at the level gauge can be preserved.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Strikers 1945 (1995)[CR]2.

These include a faithful recreation of the legendary original - available in both upright and cocktail versions - and replete with a simulation of the infamous "coloured plastic overlay" that was used to add the impression of full colour graphics to the original game.[CR]The 2 remaining game modes are 'Versus', with simultaneous split-screen 2-player action, and "Parody", which features characters and graphics from other well-known Taito games, such as "The New Zealand Story", "Bubble Bobble" and "Liquid Kids". Despite the graphical changes, the Parody version plays identically to the original game, and all modes retain the original, legendary sound effects.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]This game was available in 3 different cabinet models : the single-control upright model with one control panel that 2 players must share, the dual-control upright, where the players have their own control, and stand next to one another, and the head-to-head cocktail, where the players sit on opposite sides of the cabinet and the screen flips its orientation for each player's turn.[CR]The 'Versus' game mode is available on the dual-control upright model only.[CR]Taito B System hardware[CR]Prom Stickers : D89[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz), Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Space Invaders DX was released in September 1994.[CR]This game runs originally on the Taito B System hardware, but there is also an alternate version of this game released on Taito F3 System hardware (Game ID : D93).[CR]In ''Parody Game Mode'', a LOT of characters taken from early Taito games appear at each level, here is the list :[CR]Level 1 - Characters from "The New Zealand Story".[CR]Level 2 - Characters from "The Fairyland Story".[CR]Level 3 - Characters from "Bubble Bobble".[CR]Level 4 - Characters from "Rainbow Islands - The Story of Bubble Bobble 2".[CR]Level 5 - Characters from "Mizubaku Adventure".[CR]Level 6 - Characters from "Arkanoid".[CR]Level 7 - Characters from "KiKiKaiKai".[CR]Level 8 - Characters from "Darius".[CR]Level 9 - Characters from "Don Doko Don".[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1 :[CR]* Software version : 2.0.[CR]* Japanese release only.[CR]Revision 2 :[CR]* Software version : 2.1.[CR]* Japanese and American release (The US version has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" and "Recycle It, Don't Trash It" screens).[CR]* Added 'Configuration' menu and 'Factory setting' option in the operator menu.[CR]Revision 3 :[CR]* Taito F3 System hardware.[CR]* Software version : 2.6.[CR]* Japanese release only.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Bottom two rows: 10 pts [CR]Middle two rows: 20 pts [CR]Top row: 30 pts [CR]Saucer: Mystery[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Terra Cresta (c) 1985 Nichibutsu.[CR]Terra Cresta is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set over a constantly scrolling landscape of islands and enemy installations. The player is under constant attack from enemy spaceship waves, ground-based guns and turrets, dinosaurs and three different mothercraft ships. [CR]The levels are littered with ground-based silos bearing numbers between 2 and 5. These can be shot to release a player ship component, which then attaches to the player's current ship, increasing both its size and firepower. Power-ups available are 2-Wide shot, 3-Rear Shot, 4-Front cannon and 5-Rear shield. [CR]Using the 'Formation' button splits the ship parts into a formation for limited time, giving increased fire power. The number of parts acquired determines the formation. For example, if the player has picked up two ship parts then a triangle is formed, with the player's main ship at the rear of the formation, with additional two ship components positioned at the front edge of the triangle. [CR]When all four numbered parts have been collected, the player's ship transforms into a flaming Phoenix, and is indestructible for a limited time.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) Yamaha YM2203 (@ 4 Mhz), (2x) DAC[CR]Screen orientation : Vertical[CR]Video resolution : 224 x 256 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 256[CR]Players : 1[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Formation[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in November 1985.[CR]You can become a phoenix like in the title screen if you collect all the ship parts :).[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (G.S.M.

				<title_clean>Shmups Vert - Time Pilot</title_clean>
				<plot>Time Pilot (c) 1982 Konami Industry Company, Limited.[CR]The player controls his plane with the 8-way joystick and shoots at the enemies using the Fire button. Time Pilot consists of five different stages of play which are as follows (all these stages are also played in the attract mode unless otherwise noted in the Trivia section below) : [CR]STAGE 1 : A.D. 1910 - The Age of Biplane[CR]This stage features an ordinary blue sky with clouds. The attackers are biplanes coming from random directions. Enemy planes shoots at your plane and throw hand grenades when close to you. After 56 biplanes are destroyed, the Mother Ship appears : a giant orange blimp shooting at you! Only seven hits will destroy the Mother Ship. During the same stage, one to five parachutes will appear. Dock with them for bonus points.[CR]STAGE 2 : A.D. 1940 - The Age of Monoplane[CR]Sky is grey-blue with the same clouds.[CR]Enemies are monoplane fighters, middle-size bombers and large bomber (Mother Ship). Middle-size bombers are aiming constantly at your plane! They can be destroyed by four hits and award 1,500 points.[CR]STAGE 3 : A.D. 1970 - The Age of Helicopter[CR]Sky is once again grey-blue, only this time a different shade. The same clouds from the first two stages are also present here.[CR]Enemies now are helicopters and large one (Mother Ship). As a new level of difficulty, the helicopters are using homing missiles.[CR]STAGE 4 : A.D. 1982 - The Age of Jet Plane[CR]The sky is purple with the same clouds as the previous three stages.[CR]The enemies are modern jet fighters shooting and launching homing missiles. A modern large jet bomber is the Mother Ship. This is one of the most difficult stages of the game due to increased speed of jet fighters and random-direction attacks.[CR]STAGE 5 : A.D. 2001 - The Age of UFO.[CR]The sky is pitch black with asteroids instead of clouds.[CR]Hard to be reached and very hard to be passed. Great number of UFO's are attacking from any direction changing their angles of attack and throwing at your plane two types of Alien Weapons. The stage is fast paced and the Mother Ship, a superfortress UFO, can not be so easily destroyed. In addition, there are no enemy formations or parachutes in this stage, and there can be no more than 3 UFO's on the screen at a time.[CR]The next, Stage 6, is identical to Stage 1, but the number of planes attacking you, their speed and number of shots and grenades are gradually increased.[CR]TIME PILOT continues with Stage 7, 8... making your mission harder and harder. The game is all over when all your planes are destroyed.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX393[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), (6x) RC (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (FIRE)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Time Pilot was released in November 1982.[CR]Yoshiki was told to design a driving game. When he learned of the game's concept, he balked at making it and started on Time Pilot. As development continued, Okamoto showed his boss design docs for the driving game, all the while working on Time Pilot. Although his boss told him to do the driving game instead, he tried to take the credit for Time Pilot. Okamoto decided not to disgrace his boss and let the episode go!![CR]The background moves in the opposite direction to the player's plane, rather than the other way around; the player's plane always remains in the center.[CR]Stage 1 (A.D. 1910) and Stage 5 (A.D. 2001) are never played in the attract mode.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Centuri and Atari versions :[CR]* The purple stage with the jetplanes is set in 1983 rather than 1982.[CR]* The stage with the U.F.O.'s (A.D. 2001) is played in the attract mode.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Biplane/Fighter/Helicopter/Jet/UFO : 100 points.[CR]Bomb/Missile : 100 points.[CR]Mother Ship : 3,000 points.[CR]Bomber (A.D. 1940 only) : 1,500 points.[CR]Formation Bonus : 2,000 points.[CR]Parachute : 1,000, 2,000, 3,000, 4,000, 5,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* GAME INSTRUCTIONS :[CR]l. Control your plane with joystick. Avoid being hit by bullets, bombs and missiles. Do not crash into enemy planes.[CR]2. Advance to next stage by destroying 56 enemies and 7 hits on Mother Ship.[CR]3. Dock with parachutes for bonus points.[CR]4. Bonus plane after 10,000 points, 60,000 points and each additional 50,000 points.[CR]5. Game over when all of your planes are destroyed.[CR]* The enemy planes/ships find it hardest to shoot you when you are moving in a diagonal direction, so move this way the majority of the time. Just remember to watch your back![CR]* Since your ship is very maneuverable you can turn through 180 degrees very quickly to pick off an enemy directly behind you. Simply move the joystick or use the keys to face in the opposite direction and you will flip round.[CR]* Homing missiles - keep firing to destroy them. Alternatively, move your fighter so that the missiles move off screen, and they do not return.[CR]* The Mother Ships always move horizontally across the screen. Wait until they pass you, and then move directly behind them. You can then shoot them at will to destroy them. Again, it takes seven hits to destroy a Mother Ship.[CR]* Concentrate on collecting the parachutists where possible, as these represent your biggest potential points haul. On Stage 2 (A.D. 1940), you can leave a few planes remaining and collect parachutists for as long as possible, as this stage has no homing missiles and also more parachutists than Stage 1.[CR]* If you are killed by colliding with an enemy ship you are registered with the points as if you had shot it. This means extra lives are still awarded and also if you collide with the Mother Ship, you will advance to the next stage, providing you have at least one life remaining.[CR]* A Way To Get A Great Score : Finish Stage 1 (A.D. 1910) as soon as possible. On Stage 2 (A.D. 1940), don't shoot anything!! Eventually, parachutes will start to appear. Collect the parachutes while avoiding the planes. Each parachute (after #4) will give you 5,000 points.

				<plot>Twin Eagle II - The Rescue Mission (c) 1994 Seta Company, Limited.[CR]Twin Eagle II is a vertical scrolling shooter where one or two players pilot heavily armed helicopters through three stages with three areas each.[CR]At the start of each stage, the players select their path of attack through the three areas.  Areas with ground level enemies and targets are presented in a 3/4 isometric view, while areas with no ground targets feature scrolling landscape images.  Players use their guns to attack flying enemy aircraft and bombs to attack ground targets such as tanks, rocket launchers and high-rise skyscrapers.  If things get too hairy, the player can use a missile barrage to clear the screen of enemies and enemy firepower.  Destroying some buildings reveal primary colored trucks which drop weapon power-ups and point items when destroyed.  Each area features a boss at the end, which must be destroyed to advance past the area.  The final stage features one additional boss before the end of the game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Seta SSV system[CR]Main CPU : V60 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : ES5506 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Twin Eagle II was released in February 1994.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Twin Eagle - Revenge Joe's Brother (c) 1988 Seta.[CR]A vertical shoot-em-up that places the player's helicopter against multiple attacking targets in the air, sea, and land. Collecting the weapon and speed power-ups throughout the game is vital since the gameplay is quite difficult.[CR]The object of the game, which is not explained further, is to avenge Joe's brother - which is probably not assumed to be the player, but presumably a friend of the player who lost his brother to the enemy. (It uses bad English grammar on the subtitle of the screen, using "revenge" as a verb, as apposed to "avenge".  That being said, it's a pretty tight game otherwise.)  To do so, you must destroy the fortress on the very last level. When you start the game and it scrolls onto the starting screen, the background contains the different levels that you must survive. The starting position of the various enemies does not vary from game to game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Board Number : M6100326A[CR]Prom Stickers : UA2[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 8 Mhz), M65C02 (@ 1 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : X1-010 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Bomb[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Twin Eagle was released in April 1988 in Japan by Taito.[CR]Licensed to Romstar for US distribution.[CR]The entire sound production was done by a freelancer sound team, Goblin Sound. A soundtrack CD was released by Seta in 1989 as "Twin Eagle and Real Majhong 3".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Power-up items :[CR]1) M = Shot Multiplier[CR]2) L = Slightly increased shot length[CR]3) S = Slightly increased helicopter maneuverability[CR]4) B = Extra bomb[CR]5) Although it is ultra-rare, a floating icon can appear (instead of a balloon) which contains a full multi-shot powerup.[CR]* Completely destroying the bunkers before shooting any of the men behind them almost always yields a shot-multiplier power-up. One can regularly have the maximum number of shot multipliers by the end of the first level by using this trick. Power-ups seem to appear more frequently if you stay with your guns and do not pick up a missile power-up. Fire as often as you can when you are using the guns, and keep firing. Once you have maxed out your shot multiplier, it is good to start picking up missiles. Part of the trick to playing the game is to scroll the screen from side to side and to pick off the enemies that are placed on opposite sides to harass you.[CR]* By learning the pattern of when and where enemies appear, you can neutralize them before they can do you any harm. This is especially true with hitting the small helicopters as they come on screen, and nuking the screen just before the guided missile truck. It is best to use the screen nuke when your helicopter is positioned at the very bottom of the screen. Otherwise, it may only be partially effective.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Xevious (c) 1982 Namco.[CR]The player pilots a combat aircraft called a 'Solvalou' which is armed with a forward-firing gun for aerial targets, and bombs for destroying ground-based targets. A red targeting square is situated in front of the Solvalou, which allows the player to aim their bombs accurately. The enemy craft appears in a number of different guises; from the standard variety that arrive in large numbers but shoot slow-moving projectiles, to exploding black spheres that shoot projectiles at high speed. There are also rotating shields that cannot be destroyed and must be carefully avoided. Ground enemies are a combination of both stationary bases and moving vehicles, most of which fire slow-moving projectiles. A gigantic, floating fortress (called 'Andor Genesis') appears in certain areas; this is defeated by knocking out its core. [CR]Xevious is actually divided into 16 different areas, which are separated by an area of forest. If a player dies before less than 70% of an area has been completed, play restarts at the beginning of the same area; should a life be lost AFTER 70% of an area has been completed, however, play restarts at the beginning of the next area. After Area 16 has been completed, the game loops back to Area 7.[CR]- CAST OF CHARACTERS - [CR]AIR UNITS : [CR]These are the air units you will encounter during the game. A players skill will determine what air units they may face. [CR]* Andor Genesis (mother ship) - the large ship in Areas 4, 9, and 14. [CR]* Bacura (resistor shield) - the large rotating floating walls which are indestructible. [CR]* Brag Zakato (energy blaster) - medium black ball, with a red dot, that explode and send several shots at your Solvalou. [CR]* Bragza (crystal) - the crystal core of the Andor Genesis mother ship which escapes upon its destruction. [CR]* Garu Zakato (energy bombarder) - large black ball that explode sending out a multitude of shots in all directions. [CR]* Giddo Spario (energy blast) - small, white crystal-like projectiles that come in diagonally at your Solvalou. [CR]* Jara (spinner) - looks like a UFO with a spinning gear in the middle. [CR]* Kapi (deflector) - flat-looking fighter with two front projections that flies in, fires multiple shots, then escapes quickly. [CR]* Sheonite (escort) - small spinning diamond-shaped craft which escort your Solvalou for a bit and fly off. [CR]* Terrazi (destructor) - flat looking, diamond shaped fighter that flies in, fires multiple shots, then escapes quickly. [CR]* Torkan (scout ship) - ridged fighter that flies in, fires one shot, then escapes quickly. [CR]* Toroid (fleet) - ring-shaped fighter which is traditionally the first enemy you encounter. [CR]* Zakato (energy launcher) - small black ball that explodes sending a single shot at your Solvalou. [CR]* Zoshi (death squad) - the round spinning fighter which can sometimes attack from behind. [CR]GROUND UNITS : [CR]These are the ground units you will encounter during the game. [CR]* Barra (energy station) - small pyramid-shaped buildings. [CR]* Boza Logram (dome network) - a structure of four Lograms surrounding a Derota. [CR]* Derota (defense site) - the small octagonal-shaped gun batteries that fire multiple shots at your Solvalou. [CR]* Domogram (rover) - looks like a mobile Logram that travels along the roads and fires shots at your Solvalou. [CR]* Garu Barra (energy base) - medium and large pyramid-shaped buildings. [CR]* Garu Derota (mega site) - the large octagonal-shaped gun batteries that fire multiple shots at your Solvalou. [CR]* Grobda (tank) - the tank-like vehicles that travel along the road. They can detect when your bombsight is on them and they will move out of the way. [CR]* Logram (sphere station) - silver circular domes that fire single shots at your Solvalou. [CR]* Sol (citadel) - underground structures which rise up when initially bombed. [CR]* Zolbak (detector dome) - domes with red squares on top and around their base.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : XVI [CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (x3), MB88xx [CR]Sound Chips : Namco 3-channel WSG, discrete circuitry (for the explosion sounds) [CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 2 [CR]= &gt; [1] Zapper, [2] Blaster[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Xevious was released in December 1982 in Japan.[CR]Xevious is not the world's first vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up but has a huge and lasting influence on the genre.[CR]Xevious was the first game to use pre-rendered graphics and, among its countless innovations, was also the first vertical shoot-em-up that allowed accurate targeting of both airborne and ground-based enemies. The graphics were hugely revolutionary for their time; the sprites were rendered with remarkable clarity and detail due to the game's clever use of colors and shades as well as palette-shifting. Xevious was also the first game to feature 'hidden characters', which, being hidden, are not mentioned in the game's instructions but can be revealed by performing a secret maneuver. Among these was the 'special flag', which gave the player an extra life. This feature was carried over to a number of subsequent Namco games. [CR]While Xevious enjoyed limited popularity in North America, the game was a huge cult hit in Japan, and to this day is considered one of the greatest video games of all time. Popular Japanese musicians, Haruomi Hosono (Yellow Magic Orchestra) and Kuwata Keisuke (Southern All Stars) were known to be fans of the game, and the former produced an album of music from Namco video games, with Xevious as its centerpiece. A follow-up 12-inch single featured in its liner notes an entire science-fiction short story by Endoh, set in the world of Xevious, with even included a rudimentary fictional language. [CR]At one point in the game, the Solvalou flies over the Nazca lines. The Nazca Lines are geoglyphs (drawings on the ground) located in the Nazca Desert; a high, arid plateau that stretches 37 miles between the towns of Nazca and Palpa, situated in the Pampa region. They were created during the Nazca occupation of the area, between 200 BC and 600 AD. [CR]The graphic ROMs contain several additional enemies which don't actually appear in gameplay including a silver-grey Galaxian flagship. These enemies do appear in the game-play of "Super Xevious" which uses the same graphics data as Xevious. [CR]The highest score possible is 9,999,990, at which point the game terminates abnormally and resets. Some time before this score is reached, the game starts to award extra ships on every blaster shot fired. [CR]Marco Borroni holds the official official record for this game with 7,009,560 points (!) on August 16, 1984. [CR]The background is actually one large 1024x2048 image. Each of the 16 game areas is a 224x2048 strip starting at a different horizontal offset in the image.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]* The high-score names are ten characters long on the Namco versions, but only three characters long on the Atari versions. [CR]* The Zapper and Blaster buttons were reversed between the Japanese and American versions.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is relatively complicated due to all the different units. [CR]AIR UNITS [CR]Andor Genesis : 1,000-4,000 points [CR]Brag Zakato : 500 points [CR]Garu Zakato : 1,000 points [CR]Giddo Spario : 10 points [CR]Jarra : 70-100 points [CR]Kapi : 300 points [CR]Terrazi : 700 points [CR]Torkan : 50 points [CR]Toroid : 30 points [CR]Zakato : 50 points [CR]Zoshi : 100 points [CR]GROUND UNITS [CR]Barra : 100 points [CR]Boza Logram : 2,000 points [CR]Derota : 1,000 points [CR]Domogram : 800 points [CR]Garu Barra : 300 points [CR]Garu Derota : 2,000 points [CR]Grobda : 400 points [CR]Logram : 300 points [CR]Zolbak : 200 points [CR]Specials (see Tips and Tricks below for how to get them) [CR]Flag : 1,000 points for uncovering it, bonus Solvalou for flying over it [CR]Sol Citadel : 2,000 points for making it surface; 2,000 points for destroying it[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]When you start the game, your Solvalou will be at the bottom of the screen. Keep in mind, this is a scrolling game. This means you can go no faster then the top and no slower then the bottom of the screen. You can, however, vary your speed in-between by pushing the joystick up and down. The biggest key in getting through this game is learning how to use the joystick to speed up and slow down because you will sometimes be put into some very tight areas that will require precision joystick control.[CR]* One interesting aspect of this game is the fact if you are too successful against a particular kind of enemy, the game will adjust itself to send different enemies until you have difficulty dealing with them.[CR]* Make sure you know what you will be encountering in each area.[CR]* If you hold down the fire and bomb buttons, you will constantly be doing both at a slower rate. This is great when you are in the thick of things with both air and ground targets swarming the area.[CR]* Speaking of bombs, your Solvalou is equipped with smart bombs (so to speak). They are launch and forget weapons. When you 'paint' the target with your bomb-sight and launch your bomb, it will hit that target even when you have already flown over it. There are a couple of strategies to make your bombing runs more effective :[CR]1) When you have targets close together (usually bomb batteries are arranged this way), put a bomb between them. You will have a very good chance of taking out both batteries with one hit since you can only have one bomb on the screen at a time.[CR]2) For moving targets (such as Grobdas), anticipate the targets direction and 'lead' it a little. This basically means putting the bomb at the point where the target will run into it.[CR]3) Your bomb-sight will turn red whenever any target is 'sighted', even if the target is hidden like Sol Citadels and flags.[CR]* Keep away from the corners. These can become death traps real quickly if you are swamped by enemies.[CR]* Since you have free reign of most of the screen to move around, make sure you use all that room for maneuvering. Enemy fighters have a nasty habit of either shooting from behind your fighter or re-entering the screen from random sides. It also is handy when you are dodging a heavy volume of enemy fire.[CR]* Make sure when you are maneuvering around the Bacuras, you always leave yourself a clear 'out'.  What I mean by this is there another direction to escape instead of having to move along with the Bacuras. An occasional enemy likes to put up shots at your fighter since it is very difficult to maneuver around the rolling plates.[CR]* The Andor Genesis Motherships are pretty easy to destroy if you work quickly. Most of the time, Zakatos and Brag Zakatos precede the arrival of the Andor Genesis Mothership. Blast these out of the sky and avoid the shrapnel. When the Andor Genesis Mothership appears, lead the target a little and quickly move up and plant your bomb at the point the center of the ship will be. The less time you waste taking on this ship, the better.[CR]* Secret Message : The designer of Xevious has included a trick for generating his name right at the beginning of the game. As soon as Solvalou appears, move to the far right edge of the screen and begin bombing constantly. Continue bombing until the first set of attacking rings is very close to you and then shoot the rings. The message 'Namco ORIGINAL Program by EVEZOO' will appear on the screen.[CR]* THE FLAGS : There are four flags hidden throughout the game. These flags occur in areas 1, 3, 5, and 6. All flags are along a horizontal line across the terrain. The only way to uncover a flag is to bomb it so you will have to lay a string of bombs along the entire horizontal line. This basically means moving up quickly, dealing with enemies quickly, and dropping your bombs quickly. Once a flag is uncovered, you must fly over it to get the benefits from it.[CR]FLAG 1 : The first flag is located in the first river you encounter after you start the game. Look for the three Grobdas in a row. Just above them is a river that cuts horizontally across the terrain. Just bomb the river from left to right and around the bank closest to you. The flag should appear.[CR]FLAG 2 : After you get past the plates, look up and to the right. There is a little lake with a small river feeding into the ocean. Start in the middle of the lake and bomb toward the little river. The flag should appear around where the river dumps into the ocean.[CR]FLAG 3 : When you cross the first ocean, you will eventually see a dock/harbor at the top. The flag is located around the horizontal line that the longest pier projecting out is part of. You will need to quickly bomb that entire length to find and get the flag before the bottom scrolls your Solvalou too far up.[CR]FLAG 4 : You will see a big bird picture on the desert. At the lowest point of its tail-feathers (in the lower right corner), start to bomb horizontally from right to left. The flag will appear.[CR]* Sol Citadels : These structures require you to bomb them once to cause them to surface. They look like large storage tanks or grain silos. You then need to bomb them again to destroy them. You have a potential to collect several hundred thousand points by taking out these structures. They come in groups of 1, 4, or 8. Unlike flags, these structures are always in the same place. There are six sets of Sol Citadels.[CR]FIRST SET : One in area 2. When you see the three Grobdas in a row on the road, start laying bombs in the area around the cul-de-sac below the last tank in a right and diagonal-down point. The citadel will be even with the cul-de-sac.[CR]SECOND SET : One in area 3. When you see the Garu Bara, go to the left of the Garu Bara and start bombing. This is also the area that the second flag can be found.[CR]THIRD SET : Four in area 9. There is a clear area right before you tangle with the second Andor Genesis Mothership. Where the road splits around the woods, start to lay bombs a little below the bottom edge of the road that goes to the right. You should uncover four Sol Citadels.[CR]FOURTH SET : Eight in area 13. At the point the desert ends, there is a little grass, then the air field starts. Use the birds leg as a reference and fly straight up. When the bomb-sight glows, start bombing. This will be the lower left Sol Citadel of the group which is arranged in two rows of four citadels. You will be hard pressed to get all eight citadels.[CR]FIFTH SET : Four in area 14. After the plates roll by, look for where two roads merge into one road. At the top edge of the slanted right hand road, start dropping bombs to uncover some more citadels.[CR]SIXTH SET : Four in area 15. Look for a forest on the left side. There will be a small clearing and then a river. Bomb the small clearing to bring the citadels up. There will be very intense ground fire in this location so be especially watchful.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Xevious (1982, Arcade)[CR]2. Super Xevious (1984, Arcade)[CR]3. Vs.

Street was released in March 1991. It is a precursor to Jaleco's "Rushing Beat" series on the Nintendo Super Famicom. The series' main character (Rick Norton) shares both the name of the main character (Rick) with the appearance of the supporting character (Allen).[CR]The game's two protagonists make a cameo appearance in another Jaleco game, "Chimera Beast".[CR]This game is probably the earliest (and sadly, one of very, very few) beat 'em up that allows the player to throw the enemy into the background, providing both an increased damage output and a somewhat nice looking dose of scenario destruction. Another game that allowed for this particular move to be performed was the Super Nintendo adaptation of Batman Returns, by Konami.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The original Japanese release has Japanese texts.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Lots of special items can be found by throwing enemies into the background and breaking things.[CR]Massive throw damage: When you grab an enemy, pressing Up on the joystick followed by the Attack button will make you throw the enemy onto the background, dealing quite a bigger amount of damage than the regular side throw; and in some cases (like in levels 2 and 3), it'll allow you to kill an enemy with a single move.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Developed by C.P.

The game heroes are charged with destroying the hoards of repulsive aliens who are invading the Earth. Many of the aliens are disguised as a variety of everyday street objects; such as telephone booths, oil cans, trash cans and mailboxes. The aliens reveal their true forms as the warriors approach.[CR]Each of the 3 heroes carries their own individual weapon; Gordon has his plasma gun, Karla has a flamethrower and Scooter has an electric whip. At the end of each level, the warriors will enter a building and the shoot-em-up action will switch to a first-person perspective.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 317-0146 / 317-0147 / 317-0148[CR]Runs on the "Sega System 18" hardware.[CR]Players: 3[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR]Cabinet dimensions : 74in.

This is now a 2-button game (punch &amp; kick) instead of 3 in the original version.[CR]* Character's energy is represented by a numerical hit point value which is always on countdown to zero. Additional hit points may be added by inserting more coins into each player's corresponding coin slot.[CR]* Characters can use a reversal kick which is automatically activated if an opponent is behind you as you press the kick button. This kick knocks down enemies (except bosses) with a single hit![CR]* The gun has limited ammo, however it is possible to pick it up again if an enemy knocks it off your hand. Also each gunshot is as strong as 3 punches or kicks and knocks down most enemies in one shot.[CR]* You can play the extra stage (enemy boss revenge) more than once.[CR]* Original Timer and Credit Counter removed.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Cabinet Graphic Design: Don Marshall[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Beat Em Up - Double Dragon</title_clean>
				<plot>Double Dragon (c) 1987 Technos Japan Corp.[CR]Double Dragon is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for one or two players, featuring twin brothers and martial arts masters, "Billy &amp; Jimmy Lee". The brothers must defeat the savage street gang known as the 'Black Warriors' to rescue Billy's kidnapped girlfriend, Marian. Standing between the brothers and Marian are four huge, colorful and varied levels; each populated with a wide variety of thugs.[CR]Many of the game's enemies carry weapons (knives, baseball bats etc.) and should Billy or Jimmy manage to knock the weapons from the enemies' hands, the heroes can pick the weapons up and use them against the enemies.[CR]The Black Warriors is made up of six distinct enemy characters- plus Willy, the game's final boss - with each differing in both physical appearance and fighting style. The members of the Black Warriors consist of the following fighters: [CR]* Williams - A street punk in a tank top. In addition to the standard punches and jump kicks, his signature technique is a body blow to the stomach. He also wields weapons such as baseball bats, knives and dynamite sticks.[CR]* Rowper - A punk who wears matching-colored pants and shirtless vest. He wields all the same weapons as Williams, but can also lift and throw heavy objects such as oildrums, boxes and stones.[CR]* Linda - Female punk who usually carries a whip. She's not very strong, as she falls down to ground with a couple of punches or a single kick (because of this, she is the only regular-sized enemy who cannot be placed on a headlock).[CR]* Abobo - A tall, big-muscled bald guy. His attacks includes punches, a standing kick and a body toss. He can also lift and throw heavy objects like Rowper. Due to his large size, he cannot be put into a headlock.[CR]* Boss 1 - The first boss, a head-swap of Abobo with a Mr. T-style mohawk and beard. Fights just like Abobo, only with an added double-handed slap. Unlike Abobo, he does not use weapons. A green version of him appears as the Mission 3 boss.[CR]* Boss 2 - The second boss. A head swap of the player who uses almost all the same techniques. [CR]* Willy - The game's final boss, armed, somewhat unfairly, with a machine-gun.[CR]Double Dragon was a huge success due to the many game-play innovations it brought to the genre (see TRIVIA for details), but it demonstrates its final moment of inspired genius at the very end of the game. Should both players still be alive after the final boss has been defeated, they will then have to fight each OTHER. The winner of this fight will be the one who wins Marian's affections.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : TA-0021[CR]Main CPU : HD6309, Hitachi HD63701[CR]Sound CPU : HD6309[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151, (2x) MSM5205[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Double Dragon was released in August 1987.[CR]Double Dragon may not have been the world's first side-scrolling beat-em-up to feature depth-movement (that accolade belongs to its predecessor, "Renegade", released in 1986) but it is the world's first CO-OPERATIVE fighting game and as such completely revolutionized its genre.[CR]The varied, multi-colored sprites and hugely detailed backdrops - married to instinctive, one or two-player game-play - was something that had never really been seen in the fighting game before and Double Dragon quickly became a legend in its own right. The game would be the inspiration for an entire genre and classics such as Capcom's "Final Fight" owe a huge debt of gratitude to the Technos legend. The game was such a huge hit, that when the home versions finally came out, the rear side of the package advertised, 'You'll never have to stand in line to play Double Dragon again!'.[CR]Double Dragon's hugely innovative game-play and superb graphics proved to be too ambitious for the host Technos hardware and the game was plagued with the now notorious 'slowdown', that occurred whenever a large number of fighters appeared on-screen.[CR]The game's director, Yoshihisa Kishimoto, reportedly conceived his initial idea for Double Dragon around the date of July 20th in 1986, the 13th anniversary of Bruce Lee's death.[CR]Director Yoshihisa Kishimoto got the idea of picking up an enemy's weapon from his previous game, "Renegade" ("Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun" in Japan). During the first stage of Renegade, he noticed that the armed enemy characters were not holding their weapons when they were on the ground.[CR]On the first stage of the game, a billboard for "Nekketsu Kouha Kunio-kun" (the Japanese version of "Renegade") can be seen atop a building prior to the first boss battle.[CR]The car at Billy and Jimmy's garage resembles the interceptor from the laserdisc game "Road Blaster", which was one of director Yoshihisa Kishimoto's previous games at Data East before he left the company to work for Technos.[CR]The three kanji (Chinese characters) on the title screen, which is normally read as "Sou-Setsu-Ryuu", literally means "Twin Interception Dragon". This is an example of 'gikun', in which a kanji is used for their meaning and not their phonetic value.[CR]The fictional martial arts practiced by the Lee brothers is called Sousetsuken or 'Twin Interception Fist', which is described as a combination of Shaolin Temple Kung Fu, Karate and Tai Chi Chuan. The name is derived from Bruce Lee's own martial arts style Jeet Kune Do, or Sekkendou in Japanese, which is known as the 'Way of the Intercepting Fist'.[CR]The Lee brothers, along with the recurring enemy characters Williams and Rowper, were named after the three main heroes from the 1973 Bruce Lee film, 'Enter the Dragon'.[CR]Double Dragon contained a number of bugs, most of which were never fixed despite several revisions of the ROM. The best known is a bug in the way enemies attack the player. Sportingly, enemies will not attack the player from behind, but will instead walk up to them and try to move past so they can attack from the front. Thus, by standing with your back to an enemy, it was possible to wait for them to get close and then elbow them in the face, without fear of being attacked. Another common bug was the 'infinite bouncing' bug. Due to the fixed way in which objects in the game would bounce off walls, trees etc., it was possible to drop an item between two tree stumps on the forest level, and it would bounce back and forth forever. In the first version of the game, this could happen to player characters who fell off either stump, the only way to continue the game being to allow the timer to run down. Another less serious bug was the ability to throw weapons from one level to the next. Usually, weapons were discarded at the end of a level. On some levels however, the transition to the next level was achieved simply by scrolling the screen one whole screen to the right, or down a cliff. By standing at the extreme right of the level and jumping just as it ended, the players character would drop their weapon in mid air, throwing it far enough to be picked up again once the screen had scrolled on.[CR]Jason Wilson holds the official record for this game with 171,210 points on July 24, 1999.[CR]Apollon Music released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Original Sound of Double Dragon - KHY-1026) in cassette format on 21/02/1988. Also released the soundtrack album in CD format (Original Sound of Double Dragon - BY12-5028) on 16/12/1988.[CR]Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Legend of Game Music 2 ~Platinum Box~ - SCDC-00473~82) on 18/01/2006[CR]A Double Dragon unit appears in the abysmal 1994 movie 'Double Dragon'.[CR]A Double Dragon unit can be seen in Drake and Josh episode 'Movie Job', but the marquee reads 'Dragon'.[CR]Tiger Electronics released a board-game based on this video game (same name) in 1989 : The winner is the first player to successfully fight his or her way around the game board to Jimmy's Hideout to rescue Marian. You will pass through the slum section, the industrial section, the forest section and the hideout section on the rocky road to victory.[CR]Comic Book : Six-issue limited series published by Marvel Comics in 1991. (cover dated from July to December). Written by Dwayne McDuffie for the first four issues and by Tom Brevoort and Mike Kanterovich for the final two. In this comic, Billy and Jimmy Lee were the twin inheritors of the 'Dragon Force', a mystical force that granted the Lee brothers their powers, as they fought against the occult crime lord Nightfall. Marian is reimagined as a policewoman (a depiction later featured in the cartoon series) and Stan Lee appears as Billy and Jimmy's long-lost father.[CR]Cartoon : TV series produced by DIC Entertainment and Bohbot Entertainment, which lasted two 13-episodes seasons in 1993 and 1994. In the series, Billy and Jimmy are twin brothers who were separated at birth, with Billy being raised by his father's sensei, the Oldest Dragon, while Jimmy was raised by the evil Shadow Master to become his successor, the Shadow Boss. After the second episode, Jimmy realizes the evils of his way and joins his brother, becoming the Double Dragons. Inspired the 1994 home console fighting game "Double Dragon V: The Shadow Falls".[CR]Live-Action Movie : Released in 1994 by Imperial Entertainment. Starred Scott Wolf as Billy, Mark Dacascos as Jimmy, Alysa Milano as Marian and Robert Patrick as original villain Koga Shuko. Directed by James Yukich, with a screenplay written by Paul Dini (of Batman: The Animated Series) and Neal Shusterman. In the movie, Billy and Jimmy are young twin brothers who possess one half of a magical medallion, with the other half possessed by crime lord Shuko. It inspired the 1995 Neo-Geo game "Double Dragon".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Here's How To Get Infinite Points In Double Dragon : Level One, one player grabs the whip when it comes out. The other player relieves the enemy who walks out with a bat of that bat. But he does NOT kill that enemy. Continue moving on until you're at the end of stage one. At this point the player WITHOUT the whip grabs the now bat-less enemy. The other player finishes the stage. Note that when the boss man is dead, the clock stops running down. Then the player tortures the bat-less one with the whip. 200 points per pop, and the enemy will NEVER die. Switch to non-whip attack to kill him, and resume normal play.[CR]* To easily get through the whole game, use the following strategy. When an opponent is coming towards you from one direction, face the opposite direction. When the enemy is at arm's length, do an elbow smash. The enemy will go flying forward. While the opponent is still on the ground, face away from him/her and repeat the process. Now, you can defeat enemies without them attacking. This strategy also works for bosses.[CR]* Ghost Player : Notice that player one gets all the points for certain weapons. Notably the barrel, which is important because it is reusable. Should player one die, while player two is still alive, player one continues to get points for the barrel. If this gets him over the extra-man mark, he gets a ghost player, which is limited in the kinds of things he can do.[CR]* Infinite Knives : When an enemy carrying a knife appears on the screen (NOT an enemy that picks up a knife, but one already carrying the knife when he appears), instead of taking the knife beating the enemy, hit the weapon, causing the enemy to drop it (or let it hit a wall). Doing this you will be able to pick up and use the knife against some other enemies, while the character bearing the knife will take out a new one so you can repeat the trick. You can use this same trick with dynamite.[CR]* At the end of some levels you can throw your weapons onto the next stage. Normally you discard them, but you can cheat. This works well on level 1, for instance. When at the end of the level, just after you kill the boss, move to the extreme right of the level, as far as it will scroll. Jump up just as the level ends and scrolls to the next one, if you time it right you will let go of your weapon in mid air and it will fall onto the next stage where you can just about pick it up at the very left of the screen![CR]* Throw Objects Through the Levels : At the end of the second stage, where the elevator appears, move as far down as possible without falling. Now, when you drop weapons, or hit some enemies, these will fall off-screen instead of falling to the ground. If fallen objects like whips  or knifes fall into a certain area (near the platform), you will find them when descending into Mission 3.[CR]* Throw Enemies Into the Void : At the beginning of Mission 3 you will face two enemies; make them come as near to the left of the screen as possible, and throw them off-screen; they will die immediately as if falling into the 'void'.[CR]* At the last level after the walls you will see two guys. Kill the first one and let the second guy on wait. Now you have only one guy in front of the door waiting for you. Just pass him by and when he comes turn fast and give him a punch to turn his head. Now you crash his head. To go back to normal you have to have a second player to catch his back.[CR]* At the very end of the last stage you will notice the machine-gun man looking down on you nodding his head. Normally he will walk down when you have killed a few more hench men. Well if you can entice the BIG guy that throws you over his head towards the wall. Elbow him so he is on the ground facing the wall, at this point stand at his feet and he will throw you on the wall next to the machine gun man. You can then beat the crap out of the machine gun man with his gun on the wall still.[CR]* How to kill the final boss (Willy) in just one hit (also useful to quickly kill the other enemies in the final part of the last level) : This trick requires a lot of dexterity and skill (and a bit of luck too, as it won't work if the enemies won't lean out enough) to be achieved. In the last level, after you kill the two mohawked giants that show up smashing the wall, exploit the edge near the wall on the left to lean out downwards as much as possible (you'd better do it here and now, as later on it will become almost impossible to lean out so much without falling), then move forward and keep fighting while remaining on this edge.[CR]When Willy comes out of the steel door, wait for him to come down to the lower side of the screen; as soon as he leans out downwards enough, hit him and make him fall (be careful in using flying kicks, as you risk to fall on the spikes). If performed with the correct timing, Willy will NOT fall on the ground: he'll fall straight on the spikes, dying at once.[CR]Note : if you use this trick on all the other enemies that show up before Willy, sometimes, after the final boss is thrown in the spikes, an enemy will jump out of the spikes, and fall on them straight afterwards.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Double Dragon II - The Revenge (c) 1988 Technos Japan Corp.[CR]Following his defeat at the end of the original Double Dragon, Willy, the leader of the Black Warriors, retaliates against Billy and Jimmy Lee by murdering their friend, Marian, leaving the brothers with the task to avenge her death.[CR]The sequel to Double Dragon is essentially an upgraded version of the original game, but with with a two-way attacking system similar to one previously used in Technos Japan's 1986 arcade game "Renegade". Many of the attacks and combos from the original "Double Dragon" are retained, as well as new techniques including the invincible Cyclone Kick.[CR]The stages and weapons are redesigned versions of items previously featured in the original game. There are a few new traps such as a bulldozer in the middle of Mission 3 and all of the transition sequences between stages are now done with the character entering the next level via a lift, making it impossible to carry one weapon to the next area.[CR]Most of the enemy characters return from the original Double Dragon, with some given facelifts, but the stage bosses are all new. The enemies are as followed :[CR]* Williams - Has a wilder face and longer hair. He can now run towards the player and do cartwheels. He throws his knives in mid-air and sometimes carry a shovel which he throws towards the player.[CR]* Rowper - Has a beard and eye-patch, but otherwise is more or less identical to his original self. He carries shovels and can sometime pick up large objects.[CR]* Linda - She now has a mohawk and face paint. She can also jump off platforms and do the elbow strike against the player. In addition to the ball and chain, she also carries grenades and knives.[CR]* Oharra - A strongman with a clean-shaved face. Replaces Abobo from the first game and has the same attacks.[CR]* Bolo - A head-swap of Oharra with long hair and beard. Replaces the mohawked head-swap of Abobo from the first game.[CR]* Jeff - Same as his original self, but now carries grenades.[CR]* Burnov - The boss of Mission 1. An obese wrestler whose face is concealed with a mask. He grabs the player and throws similar punches in the face. After dying, he will stand up and yell, disappearing in front of the player and leaving only his clothes. In later encounters, he will revive himself at least once.[CR]* Abore - The boss of Mission 2. A huge suspender-wearing strongman with Terminator-like sunglasses. His slaps and shoulder tackles do massive damage to the player.[CR]* Chin Taimei - The boss of Mission 3. A Chinese martial artists armed with twin kali sticks. In addition to his energy-draining stick combo, he also has a jump kick and sweep kick.[CR]* Willy - The boss of Mission 4. Looks like he does in the original game, but now dresses in red. He still uses the same machine gun from the first game.[CR]* The clone - After defeating Willy, the player will have to fight their character's evil self. This clone has all the techniques the player has, but can also throw energy beams and possess the player's body to drain his energy.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : TA-0026[CR]Main CPU : HD6309 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 8 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; Punch, Kick, Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Double Dragon II was released in December 1988. It was then licensed to Romstar for US distribution in January 1989.[CR]The yelling sound heard when a coin is inserted comes from an enemy in the game called 'Chin Taimei' (the mission 3 boss that fights using 2 sticks).[CR]Billy and Jimmy trade their original blue and red outfits for black and white respectively in the game. They appear in the game's ending wearing their original colors. Marian wears a yellow dress in the game and her character sprite is slightly redrawn from the original game.[CR]Unlike the original "Double Dragon", the controller configuration for part two were changed from standard punch and kick buttons to less conventional left attack and right attack buttons.[CR]In the same way the original "Double Dragon" paid tribute to the laserdisc game "Road Blaster", Double Dragon II features a similar homage to the laserdisc version of "Cobra Command" ("Thunder Storm" in Japan), which was Yoshihisa Kishimoto's debut game. The helicopter inside the garage at the beginning of the game is the same helicopter from Cobra Command.[CR]Double Dragon II originally began development as a chip upgrade of the first game. Originally only the stages were going to be changed, but there was an incentive to add more features to the game, such as new attacks and enemy characters, which required the game to be developed on a new hardware.[CR]Isaiah Johnson holds the official record for this game with 47,880 points on May 31, 2008.[CR]Meldac / Nippon Crown released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Double Dragon II The Revenge - MECG-28001) on 10/03/1990.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>The Cliffhanger - Edward Randy (c) 1990 Data East.[CR]A fast moving platform game in which the player controls the Indiana Jones-esque and unfortunately named 'Edward Randy'. The levels are an inventive mix of standard platform action and 3-D scrolling levels; the latter usually having the player driving a jeep and repelling the enemy attacks. The game is based on the archetypal Hollywood action blockbuster and features a filmic score to back up the on-screen action. The player's only weapon is a whip - another nod to the Indiana Jones character - which can be used to both attack enemies and as a 'rope', to enable the player to reach distant platforms.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : MAD[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Hudson Soft HuC6280 (@ 4.0275 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM2203 (@ 4.0275 Mhz), YM2151 (@ 3.58 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 7.627 Khz), OKI6295 (@ 15.255 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in January 1991.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Edward Randy, Super Burger Time - PCCB-00061) on 21/04/1991.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Game planner : Lungfish[CR]Software programmer : Hiroki[CR]Hardware designer : Turk K.K[CR]Graphic designers : Hitomi Fujiwara, Kinya Aoyama[CR]Sound arrange &amp; compose : Akira Takemoto (Raika)[CR]Sound effects : Hiroaki Yoshida (MARO)[CR]Thanks to : R.

				<title_clean>Beat Em Up - Golden Axe: The Revenge of Death Adder</title_clean>
				<plot>Golden Axe - The Revenge of Death Adder (c) 1992 Sega.[CR]Like it's legendary prequel, 1989's "Golden Axe"; 'Revenge' is sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which the evil 'Death Adder' has arisen to take over the lands. The game supports simultaneous four-player gameplay, with each player taking on one of the game's characters. The four available characters are 'Sternblade' (a barbarian warrior), 'Dora' (a female centaurian), 'Goah' (a giant with a dwarf sitting atop his shoulders) and 'Little Trix' (an agile, oriental-style warrior).[CR]As with 'Golden Axe', as well as standard weapon attacks, each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will cause the player to charge and smash into opponents. At certain points during the game, players will come across certain creatures and contraptions (such as dragons, giant scorpions and catapults) which, once the original occupier has been removed from the saddle, can be mounted and ridden/utilized to attack the enemy.[CR]At certain points during a level, as well as at the end of each level, dwarfs appears carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the dwarfs causing them to drop food and magic potions. During the course of the game, players will also come across numerous trapped prisoners. These can be released by either opening their cages (by pulling a rope or similar) or hacking at their foot manacles.[CR]Unlike the linear level layout of its prequel, 'Revenge' offers the player a branching route through the game, adding to its variety and longevity.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "System 32" hardware.[CR]Players: 4[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Golden Axe TRODA was released in July 1992.[CR]Gilius, the dwarf of the first episode is not directly playable on this sequel, but appears on the back of a giant named Goah.[CR]Each time when you win a stage a map screen shows up. That map screen actually contains ancient Greek words, which translate as follows:[CR]* The word at the bottom means 'river'. [CR]* The bottom-left word means 'cave'. [CR]* The bottom-right word means 'forest'. [CR]* The word in the center means 'town'. [CR]* The upper-left word means 'graveyard'. [CR]* The word in the upper-right corner means 'sea'. [CR]* And finally the word on top is the name of an ancient Greek mythological monster.[CR]Wave Master released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Golden Axe The Music - WM-0595~7) on 21/02/2008 containing music from the original arcade and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis series.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The Japanese version has some differences:[CR]* Has 5 scenes (levels) instead of 7.[CR]* Is a 2 players game only instead of 4.[CR]* You have 2 lives and 24 of energy instead of 1 live and 40 of energy.[CR]The US version has some differences:[CR]* Forces the player to play all the 7 scenes (stages) of the game in a single play-through, while other versions present two intersections (both 2-ways) during the game to the player to choose from, so he/she can only see 5 scenes in a single play-through. Needless to say the latter make more sense.[CR]* Is a 4-player game while other versions are 2-player.[CR]* You have 1 live and 40 unit of energy while other versions have 2 live and 24 unit of energy.[CR]* Has the "Recycle It, Don't Trash It!" and the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When 2 or more people are playing, it's possible to grab an enemy in a body slam technique by attacking the enemy simultaneously, which can cause a lot of damage.[CR]* In the PIER level, when the tentacles appear, attacking them will chop the tentacle's tip off. The tip can then be picked up (and eaten) and will increase the player's health, having the same effect as the dwarf's food powerup.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Beat Em Up - Gaia Crusaders</title_clean>
				<plot>Gaia Crusaders (c) 1999 Noise Factory.[CR]A 1 or 2-player scrolling beat-em-up, with players selecting a character from a choice of 5; in which 2 'Elemental Warriors' must battle Satan and his army of demons that have captured and taken over the world. Each player-character possesses either Wind strength, Fire strength, or a mix of the 2.[CR]Gaia Crusaders is heavily influenced by another scrolling beat-em-up, Capcom's 1989 classic, "Final Fight", and also, to a lesser degree, by Sega's legendary "Golden Axe", also from 1989. The latter is particularly evident in the use of the Magical Attack, which acts as a smart bomb and is also identical to the magic attacks featured in 'Golden Axe'.[CR]Gaia Crusader's superb combo-geared control layout allows players to produce some highly impressive moves and attacks.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Cave 1st Generation Hardware[CR]Main CPU : MC68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 [Optional][CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YMZ280B (@ 16.9344 Mhz) or OKIM6295 x (1 or 2) + YM2203 / YM2151 [Optional][CR]Other : 93C46 EEPROM[CR]Control per player: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons per player: 4 [PUNCH, KICK, JUMP, MAGIC BOMB][CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 1999.[CR]This is the first Noise Factory game.

At the end of Stage 5, he buffs up and turns green.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]When the DIP switch is set to English, the Japanese subtitle written in kanji underneath the title reads 'Seisensha'. This could be translated (rather clumsily) to 'Journeying Soldier' or (to the better sounding) 'Crusader' for this particular instance, since there is a religious overtone in the prologue of the game, even though the Japanese word 'Seisensha' is as secular as the word 'chair' and doesn't contain a underlying religious meaning such as with the case of the word 'Crusader'.[CR]When the DIP switch is set to Japanese, the Japanese subtitle is just the title of the game written in katakana, which is read as 'Gaia Kuruseidaazu'.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producer : Ijyu Keiko[CR]Planner : Yamamoto Jun[CR]Main programmer : Kazuaki Ezato[CR]Enemy programmer : Hidenari Mamoto[CR]Character designers : Maeda Masahiro, Nana Isiguro, Yosikazu Nisikawa, Morita Haruhiko[CR]Background designers : Ijyu Keiko, Nakai Yuka[CR]Voices : Toshikazu Tanaka, Maeda Masahiro, Yosikazu Nisikawa, Kazuaki Ezato, Morita Haruhiko, Hidenari Mamoto[CR]Sound producer : Toshikazu Tanaka[CR]Special thanks : Watanabe Hidekazu, Aizawa Masato, Takashiro Hikaru, Nakagawa Hiroko, Murata Range[CR]</plot>

Musashi had an opportunity to see Kojiro's sword sometime before the duel and knew of it's great length. Musashi carved the wooden sword to be of greater length. When Musashi arrived on the beach for the duel, he kept the wooden sword hidden behind him until the duel began. He jumped over a low strike of Kojiro, reaching about a meter off the ground and came down hard on Kojiro's head with his heavy wooden sword. Kojiro lay dying on the sand and Musashi left in a hurry without killing him. Some of Musashi's critics call him a coward for not killing him, but Musashi had proved his point as the killing of Kojiro was not the goal - defeating him was. This is why the Kojiro character in Musashi Ganryuki has a huge gash on his forehead. The storyline of Musashi Ganryuki is that Kojiro has come back from the dead to try and kill Musashi.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Here are the statistics for the two characters :[CR]Musashi : Power 4 - Dexterity 2 - Vitality 4[CR]Suzume : Power 2 - Dexterity 5 - Vitality 3[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producer : Ume.W[CR]Programmers : S.

				<plot>Gauntlet Legends (c) 1998 Atari Games Corp.[CR]Gauntlet Legends is a fantasy themed action game, a sequel to 1985's popular "Gauntlet" and 1986's "Gauntlet II". Its unusual features for an arcade game included passwords and characters that could be saved, enabling players to play over the course of a long period of time. It was a role-playing game, though with very limited role-playing.[CR]The simplicity of the original Gauntlet series is still here : You have to find your way out of a maze using keys, secret passages, and switches. In your way are hordes and hordes of enemies, endlessly reproducing themselves from generators painfully spread around the gigantic, menacing levels.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "Atari Vegas" hardware.[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in October 1998.[CR]Jeff Shears worked as a Senior Artist on this game for over 9 months. Like a number of people who worked on the game, Jeff was left off the final in-game credits.[CR]A Gauntlet Legends unit appears in the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men'; Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Alternate characters : Get a character to level 10. Then, hold Turbo while selecting your character to gain a more powerful version ('Jackal' instead of Wizard, 'Minotaur' instead of Warrior, 'Falconess' instead of Valkyrie, 'Tigress' instead of Archer).[CR]* Passwords :[CR]Play as a level 55 Wizard - Enter LBE as initials and 222 as password.[CR]Play as a level 99 Valkyrie - Enter COP as initials and 012 as password.[CR]Play as a Level 99 Warrior - Enter JOE as initials and 123 as password.[CR]Play as a Level 99 Wizard - Enter MO_ as initials and 000 as password.[CR]Play as Pojo the Chicken (from "Mace - The Dark Age") - Enter EGG as initials and 911 as password[CR]Nude Valkyrie - Have player two enter NUD as initials and 069 as password (ONLY works on the Blue Valkyrie).[CR]* Level Benefits : In Gauntlet, there are various rewards for gaining levels. Here they are, in order...[CR]Level 10 : Gain access to secret character (Hold turbo while selecting), get better weapon[CR]Level 25 : Gain Familiar (Little pet at your shoulder)[CR]Level 50 : Gain best possible weapon[CR]Level 75 : Gain Auto-Aiming Familiar[CR]Level 99 : Permanent Growth (Character can not be knocked down by a Golem's attack)[CR]* Get a Bird/Dragon Familiar : To get a Bird/Dragon Familiar,(it varies on which of the 8 characters you are using) get up to level 25 and you will get a bird/dragon companion. When you attack, your bird/dragon also attacks.[CR]* Another Familiar : To get a more powerful, permanent familiar after you reach level 25, get your character to level 75. Your familiar will be replaced by another familiar, the most powerful one you can get for your character. Your familiar attacks by shooting a small, but strong ball of energy when you attack.[CR]* Punch Through Walls : If there are Golems on the other side of a wall, walk up to it and hit FIGHT and you can kill the Golem without getting hurt.[CR]* Drain Death : When you get an Anti-Death item, use it to gain health points by draining death. All you have to do once you have the item is to find death and run into him.[CR]* Drain Multiple Deaths : Once you get an Anti-Death power-up, you can take 100 life away from a Death. the trick is to take as much away from one Death without taking 100. You will still have the power-up, and you can get life this way until it wears off.[CR]* Extended Invulnerability : In any level where there is a silver invulnerability you can use this cheat. Buy a Gold invulnerability before starting the level. It's recommended to buy 2 because it will last longer but it can be done with one. Go through the level and grab the silver invulnerability while you still have the gold one. Now quickly exit the level.[CR]In the shop buy another gold invulnerability. When you enter the next level you will have the gold, but when it wears off you will have the silver from the last level![CR]WARNING! This code WILL NOT WORK if the silver invulnerability is wearing off before you exit the level.[CR]* Rune Stone Locations : Each stage has 3 Rune Stones which are to be found, so that the game can be completed properly. Below are the locations of the 3 Rune Stones for each realm.[CR]MOUNTAIN REALM. Difficulty : Easy[CR]1st Rune Stone can be found on the peak, after climbing a few hills. You will come to a part where there are 2 generators, and in between them is a statue. Destroy the statue to uncover the Rune.[CR]The 2nd stone can be found in the cliffs. Ignore the first EXIT that you come across. Instead continue along the path above the EXIT, breaking the wall, fighting the Golem, continuing along the path until you come across 2 bridges, and take the top bridge. Once across, hit the wall at the end of the bridge to uncover the Rune.[CR]The 3rd is in the cavern. Ignore the first EXIT once again. When you're getting near the second EXIT, you will be at a T - Junction. Going right leads to the second EXIT and 2 Golems. Going left, fighting all the enemies, and then going to the wall at the far left and hitting it will uncover the final Rune for this realm.[CR]CASTLE REALM. Difficulty : Medium[CR]The 1st Rune Stone is in the dungeon. You should notice the Rune as soon as you start the level in a cage, but you have to get it down, somehow. Down the stairs, go south, cross the log bridge, and onto a kind of island place, fight the Golem. Press the trap release switch, located to the east. If you walk around and step on the FAR LEFT of the big leaf, that will lower the runestone enabling it to be grabbed.[CR]The 2nd will be found in the armory. From the start, go right, down the stairs, pass the blades (notice red barrel and rat mound after blades), then go down and press the switch - you will notice walls come down and a Golem come to life, defeat the Golem and go to the wall under stairs, hit it to uncover the Rune.[CR]The 3rd final rune stone for this level is in the treasury. Get to the room with a throne in it. From there go down the stairs and to the right(towards top of screen), keep walking until you come a room that has a box type thing in it. Destroy the box type thing to uncover the Rune.[CR]FOREST REALM. Difficulty : Medium[CR]The 1st rune is in roots. After the elevator, proceed up and to the left, you will come across a Golem, destroy it. You will come across a big tree stump in the middle of the screen, hit the tree stump a few times to break the outer wall, and it will reveal the Rune.[CR]The 2nd is in the tree (2 PLAYERS NEEDED!) After coming across Death inside a barrel, proceed right,you will come across a switch that reveals a bridge, as soon as you try cross it, it disappears, that is why 2 players are needed. Based on the fact you had 2 players, you will come across a tree that has a circular cut. Inside the cut-out area will be another switch, activate it, then walk to the right, across the BIG green leaf, across the path. You will notice a branch that rises to the right. It will have a platform on it, which has the Rune on it.[CR]The 3rd rune is in branches. After getting to the stump path (The path made of cut trees), you will continue onwards, until you come across a stump by itself, continue up to the right, until you come across a wall guarded by two archers, destroy them, the destroy the wall behind them to uncover the Rune.[CR]DESERT REALM. Difficulty : Hard[CR]The 1st Rune stone is in the ruins. Proceed down the stairs from the first EXIT, and you will now be in water. Go to the left and down until you come across a door, open it, and walk to the jutted edge of the walkway, and the Rune will come up, grab it.[CR]The 2nd Rune Stone is in the temple. Proceed to the screen that has a statue in the middle that is lit by light beams from four corners. The light comes from four places around the edge of the screen. To stop the light step on the 4 large blue switches located around the screen, once this is done, the statue will be replaced by the Rune, grab it.[CR]The last rune in the pyramid is a tricky one. Proceed to the first fighting screen after coming down the first platform. Go to the upper left corner of the screen. There is a slanted slope with sand on the bottom of it, walk up it and open both doors. Then you will see a switch and a yellow potion on a brick. Hit the switch and the potion will move up. Now come down and WALK ALL THE WAY AROUND the catwalk, walk down the slope when the catwalk ends, and then down the slope after that. You should now see a fence with a treasure chest, an archer and a switch behind it. Walk down towards the bottom of the screen, you will see a switch and enemy generators. Hit the switch and go back to where you saw the fence, it should have dropped. Go hit the switch. Walk down the left side, you should walk through a gate under a passageway. Continue down the left side. Kill enemies, but careful Death is in the middle of the room. When you reach the bottom left of the screen, there should be spikes from the ground, then a key, a slope, a yellow potion, a slope and then a platform with enemies to fight. The Rune will be located behind a wall near spikes on the far left of this platform.[CR]* Defeating the Chimera : In the castle level, before you go to the boss, Chimera, buy 'reflective shield' in the shop. When level starts, run up the stairs and wake up the Chimera, and stand far enough back so that it can't breathe fire on you. Keep firing at it and it kills itself.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Beat Em Up - Golden Axe</title_clean>
				<plot>Golden Axe (c) 1989 Sega.[CR]Golden Axe is a sideways scrolling beat-em-up set in a traditional fantasy world, in which up to three warriors take up arms to rescue the kidnapped King and his Queen from the evil Death Adder.[CR]The game's three different playable characters are an Amazonian warrior named Tyris Flare, a Barbarian hero named Ax Battler, and a Viking dwarf named Gilius Thunderhead. Each character has a special attack move that is activated by pressing both JUMP and ATTACK at the same time. Also, double-tapping the joystick right or left will make the character charge and smash into opponents.[CR]At certain points during the game, players will come across enemies riding creatures (such as dragons). If the player knocks the original rider from the saddle, the created can be mounted and used against the enemy.[CR]At certain points during a level, as well as on the between-stage intermittent levels, Thieves appear carrying a sack on their back. Players can hit the Thieves causing them to drop food and magic potions - the latter of which are used to create a special magical attack that damages or kills all on-screen enemies.[CR]Each of the game's heroes uses a different kind of magic: Ax Battler uses Earth magic, Tyris uses fire magic and Gilius uses lightning magic. In addition: each player character also carries a different weapon: Tyris and Ax Battler both use swords while Gilius wields an axe.[CR]Golden Axe consists of 9 levels, although only 5 of these are true levels as every 2nd stage is a short intermittent level featuring only the sack-carrying Goblins.[CR]Once Golden Axe has been beaten, an end sequence is a scene of a video arcade, in which the game's characters jump out of the arcade cabinet and chase the game's players out of the arcade and down the street.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "System 16B" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 317-0110[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; [A] JUMP, [B] ATTACK, [C] MAGIC[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Golden Axe was released in June 1989.[CR]Re-Editions:[CR]"Golden Axe [Model 317-0120]"[CR]"Golden Axe [Model 317-0121]"[CR]Export releases:[CR][US] "Golden Axe [Model 317-0112]"[CR][US] "Golden Axe [Model 317-0122]"[CR][US] "Golden Axe [Model 317-0123]"[CR]Uchida originally wanted to make a theme similar to "Dragon Quest", but seeing as how the higher ups at Sega didn't quite see the charm in that, Uchida and his team ended up making Golden Axe, thinking that selectable characters and flashy magic spells would make for a success. The game did end up becoming one of Sega's big franchises early on and spawned multiple sequels.[CR]Note : The kanji on the title screen actually reads 'Senpu', meaning 'Fighting Axe'. This is an example of 'gikun', where Japanese artists use the phonetic value of a character to determine the game's name and not the meaning of the character itself.[CR]Many of the samples used for Golden Axe and its sequel were taken from the movies 'Rambo - First Blood' and 'Conan the Cimmerian'. More specific when you kill bad guys sometimes they scream something like 'Oooh God!' which was taken from Rambo at the scene which takes place in the forest when one of the policemen fell into a trap and gets impaled by sharp pieces of wood. The sample used for the man who gets trampled by a bad guy in Golden Axe and the scream of Death-Adder when falling from the dragon at the final scene of "Golden Axe - Revenge of Death-Adder" was taken from the policeman who also fell from the helicopter pursuing Rambo. Finally the battle cry used for the big baddies when they die in Golden Axe and the scream for the big chained green monster on "Golden Axe - Revenge of Death-Adder" on stage 3 are the same and taken from Conan's scene where Arnold Schwarzenegger fights the two villains on a Stonehenge like background and again one of them gets impaled by a trap.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Super Sonic Team : G.S.M. SEGA 3 - PCCB-00009) on October 21, 1989.[CR]Wave Master released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Golden Axe The Music - WM-0595~7) on February 21, 2008 containing music from the original arcade and Sega Mega Drive/Genesis series.[CR]Two limited Edition Comic Book Series' to accompany the game were published in the UK in the early 1990's. They can be found along with other Sega-related adaptions in Fleetway's 'Sonic The Comic' which ran for approximately 200 issues.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Two Player Health Restoration : If a player's health is at zero (no life bar visible) when the bonus level/intermission ends, s/he will begin the next level at full health (three life bars). So if you CAREFULLY hack one another, you can restore your health. You should allow the other character to recover after each swipe, otherwise you may throw or kick and actually kill the other player.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Beat Em Up - Michael Jackson's Moonwalker</title_clean>
				<plot>Michael Jackson's MoonWalker (c) 1990 Sega.[CR]Based on the movie of the same name, Moonwalker is a scrolling, isometric beat' em up in which Michael Jackson (1958-2009), along with his chimp Bubbles, attempts to save children and defeat the evil 'Mr. Big'. During each round, the player must defeat each and every one of Mr. Big's henchmen and the deadly enemy machines that patrol the levels. This is achieved either by shooting them with Michael Jackson's 'magical energy', or by using his Dance Magic - the game's equivalent of a smart bomb. Some enemies take only one shot to defeat whereas others take several shots before they are destroyed. The longer the player holds down on the fire button, the greater the amount of magical energy Michael can inflict. At the start of each round, the player is given 2 dance magic smart bombs. Towards the end of each round, Michael's pet chimpanzee, Bubbles, will be seen moving about. If Michael touches Bubbles, he will turn into a powerful robot (the 'Moonwalker' of the game's title). After Michael has become Moonwalker, he will be able to shoot lasers and fire missiles. Michael must defeat every boss enemy at the end of each round in order to proceed to the next.[CR]Each player's Michael Jackson character looks identical but wears a different colour : white (left player), red (middle player), and black (right player).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 317-0157 / 317-0158 / 317-0159[CR]Runs on the Sega "System 18" hardware.[CR]Players: 3[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 1990.[CR]Moonwalker is made up of 5 stages, each featuring a different Michael Jackson track for the instrumental background music. The stage music is as follows...[CR]1. Cavern : 'Bad'[CR]2. Amusement Quarter : 'Smooth Criminal'[CR]3. Night Street : 'Beat It'[CR]4. Graveyard : 'Another Part Of Me'[CR]5. Evil Fortress : a reprise of 'Bad'[CR]If you complete all 5 stages and finish the game, the song that will play for the ending will be 'Billie Jean'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]FD1094 317-0157[CR]* Japanese version.[CR]FD1094 317-0158[CR]* US version.[CR]* Additional "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR]FD1094 317-0159[CR]* World version.[CR]BOOTLEG[CR]* no I8751 @ 8 Mhz :-)[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Game concept &amp; Design by : Michael Jackson[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]A version of Moonwalker was released for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis and Sega Master System. It retained most of the gameplay elements of the arcade game that inspired it, but the isometric viewpoint was dropped in favor of sideways scrolling. The end result had more in common with Namco's "Rolling Thunder" than with the arcade MoonWalker.[CR]Versions of the game with completely different gameplay to both the arcade and console versions were released for the popular 8-bit and 16-bit home computers of the time : Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Commodore 64, Commodore Amiga, MS-DOS, MSX and ZX Spectrum.[CR]</plot>

During this time, Drew created the Ninja Baseball Bat Man video game concept (including the English title, plot and characters) and licensed it to Irem America in 1991. To illustrate the characters' sketches, Drew hired Gottlieb's well-known pinball artist, Gordon Morison.[CR]Drew's concept came up after he read the top grossing films during its time in a USA Today newspaper. One was Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, the other was one of the Batman films (possibly Batman Returns). After that, he started creating his own superhero influenced by what he saw in the USA Today newspaper. During the development of his concept, he liked the word NINJA, because of it sounding mysterious to him. He gave the protagonists baseball bats and baseballs as their main weapons, as well as dressing them in baseball uniforms, because both the sport baseball was quite popular nationally in Japan, and Drew is also a baseball fan. Drew thought the baseball bat idea was also probably an influence from the 1973 film Walking Tall. The word MAN in the title comes from Joe Don Baker who starred in the film, while he was a man. He later created the concept for the other characters such as enemies. To illustrate the characters' sketches, Drew hired Gottlieb's well-known pinball artist, Gordon Morison.[CR]Drew's original gameplay ideas for the video game was for a 1-player, adventure-based, platform game similar to Nintendo's "Super Mario Bros.". However, due to the very successful game sales of several 4-player games (most of them being beat 'em ups), Drew added 3-players in an effort to compete with the 4-player games. While the title and characters were Drew's concept, Irem Japan programmed the arcade game, and modified the look of its prototype. Drew did not mind it being different, as he was thrilled about it being programmed by them.[CR]During the development of the 2-player platform version, the two main characters were named Willie and Mickey, named after Drew's two favorite baseball players of his childhood, Willie Mays and Mickey Mantle.[CR]During the development of the 4-player beat 'em up version, the prototype names of the four main characters were Captain Jeff (red), Nunchaks Sugar (green), Hammer' Eddy (yellow) and Naginata Jimmy (blue). Drew later came up with the final names of the four protagonists that are currently used in the finished version today, which the names are references to the four baseball stars during the arcade game's release: Jose Canseco (red), Ryne Sandberg (green), Roger Clemens (yellow) and Darryl Strawberry (blue). In Japan, they were named after their colors.[CR]A year after its concept was created and a year before it was released, despite it being interesting in his opinion, Drew left the company in 1992 and moved to Data East USA. Because of that, he was unable to market nor manage any other input related to the game.[CR]An advert for "Mahou Keibitai Ganhooki", another Irem game, appears on the Ninja Baseball's first stage.[CR]Internet video game critic James Rolfe released an Angry Video Game Nerd special about Ninja Baseball BatMan in 2011.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Planner: Chinta[CR]Graphic designers: Kon.

				<plot>PuLiRuLa (c) 1991 Taito Corporation.[CR]PuLiRuLa is a six-level, sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 or 2 players that defies any logic in either its theme or its graphical approach; that places the players in a dream-like world populated by armies of strange and bizarre creatures. [CR]PuLiRuLa's plot centres around the world of 'Radishland'. Each of Radishland's six towns is kept running smoothly with the aid of a giant key, which is necessary to keep the world's 'time-flow' moving. The key is stolen by a mysterious enemy and the timeflow is disrupted. Players must fight their way through waves of increasingly abstract enemies in their quest to recover the key and restore time to Radishland. [CR]To aid players in their quest, they are each armed with a magical stick, with which they can hit and defeat the game's abstract enemies. Players are also armed with a limited number of smart bombs, capable of killing multiple enemies. The smart bombs are as visually unique as the rest of the game; taking the form of such things as a herd of running animals, a purple dancing blob-like man or a man in a giant microwave oven who captures and cooks any on-screen enemies. When killed, the enemies disappear and an animal or townsperson is released from inside the creature.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "Taito F2 System" hardware.

Locations include apartments, a hospital, a factory and a casino.[CR]Riot City is practically a direct copy of Capcom's superb 'Final Fight', with both gameplay and graphical style heavily copied from the 1989 classic. One gameplay difference is that Riot City does not allow players to pick up and use weapons as they can in Final Fight, although bonus items found in various containers can be collected.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Sega System 16B hardware[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 5 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 4 Mhz), UPD7759 (@ 640 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in May 1991.[CR]Developed by Westone.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Pretty Soldier Sailormoon (c) 1995 Banpresto.[CR]A 1 or 2-player sideways scrolling beat-em-up sees the Sailor Senshi fighting their way through five levels of anime-based combat. Each Sailor Soldier - chosen from a selection of 5, stiletto and mini skirt-wearing combatants - can punch, kick, jump, and throw their enemies; before finally reaching the traditional end-of-level boss.[CR]As with Capcom's "Final Fight", and indeed many other games of the genre, items that aid the player are either dropped by beaten enemies or revealed after hitting certain obstacles and containers. Food can be used to replenish lost health and various trinkets can be picked up for bonus points. Finally, magic crystals can be found and are needed to activate the 'special attack' move. This works in a similar way to Sega's "Shinobi", with every enemy on the screen taking a hit.[CR]Players must have at least one crystal to use the Special attack and up to 5 crystals can be carried at once. The more crystals the player holds when the special attack is utilized, the more effective it is against the game's enemies. Each level features its own unique, anime style animation. On level five, Sailor Soldier's signature attack move, from the original Japanese anime upon which the game is based, makes an appearance.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : BP945A[CR]Runs on the Cave 68000 System Hardware.[CR]Main CPU : MC68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 [Optional][CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YMZ280B (@ 16.9344 Mhz) or OKIM6295 x (1 or 2) + YM2203 / YM2151 [Optional][CR]Other : 93C46 EEPROM[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal [CR]Video Resolution : 320 x 240 Pixels [CR]Screen Refresh : 57.55 Hz [CR]Palette Colors : 32768[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; [A] Attack, [B] Jump, [C] Special Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Sailor Moon was released on March 22, 1995.[CR]This game was developed by Gazelle Co, Ltd., and is based on the Toei Manga cartoons and comics of the same name :[CR]'Sailor Moon' : 'Moon Tiara Action'.[CR]'Sailor Mercury' : 'Mercury Bubble Spray'.[CR]'Sailor Mars' : 'Mars Fire Soul'.[CR]'Sailor Jupiter' : 'Supreme Thunder'.[CR]'Sailor Venus' : 'Twin Crescent Beam'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version published and developed by Sega has the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Whenever Tuxedo Mask appears, pick up the rose he throws to regain full health.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Supervisor : Naoko Takeuchi, Fumio Osano[CR]Executive Producer : Kisaburoh Higashi[CR]Producer : Johan Satoh[CR]Total Co-ordinator : Toshifumi Kawashima[CR]Director : Hiroyuki Fujimoto[CR]Art Director : Satoshi Iwataki[CR]Art Co-director : Toshinobu Komazawa[CR]Graphic Designers : Mihoko Sudoh, Otokazu Eda, Yuhko Tataka, Shingo Ishikawa, Mikio Yamaguchi, Kumi Kayama, Noboru Inamoto, Junya Inoue, Masayuki Ohsumi, Tohru Iwataki[CR]Animation Director : Kensei Sasaki[CR]Animation art director : Kazuko Tadano[CR]Animator : Hiromi Matsushita, Studio Live[CR]Animation Digitizers : Miki Higuchi, Mutsuo Danki, Hiroko Koyano, Mayumi Onodera[CR]Music Composer : Seiichi Sakurai[CR]Sound Effects : Yoshitatsu Sakai[CR]Hardware Supervisor : Hideki Ikinaga[CR]Hardware Co-ordinator : Kazuhisa Takasu[CR]Hardware Designer : Hiroyuki Nagayoshi[CR]All program works by Hiroyuki Fujimoto.[CR]Game Designers : Hiroyuki Fujimoto, Satoshi Iwataki[CR]* Character Voice [From the default hiscore table initials] :[CR][KOT] : Kotono Mitsuishi (Sailor Moon)[CR][AYA] : Aya Hisakawa (Sailor Mercury)[CR][MIC] : Michie Tomizawa (Sailor Mars)[CR][EMI] : Emi Shinohara (Sailor Jupiter)[CR][RIK] : Rika Fukami (Sailor Venus)[CR]Special Thanks To : Hiroshi Takeda, Iriya Azuma, Higuchi Munehisa, Haruhisa Udagawa, Akira Nagamatsu, Kunihito Hiramatsu, Masaki Onda[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Beat Em Up - Shadow Force</title_clean>
				<plot>Shadow Force - Henshin Ninja (c) 1993 Technos.[CR]Shadow Force is a side-scrolling platform beat-em-up for one or two players, who choose to play as one of four Ninjas and must use all the means at their disposal to free the world from the grip of the evil Dr. Wong and his terrifying 'Theaser' organization.[CR]Shadow Force has 6 buttons: 2 for punches (low and high) 2 for kicks (low and high) 1 for jumping and 1 for possessing an enemy. Additional attack moves can be utilised by moving the joystick up or down and pressing punch and kick buttons. It's also possible to combine punch and kick attacks to obtain different combos and while the enemies can do the same, the number and variation of their attacks is generally lower than those available to the players.[CR]In addition to being able to possess nearby enemies, Shadow Force also features something else new to the side-scrolling beat-em-up genre; at the end of each stage players take part in a bonus round consisting of a one-on-one fight. [CR]Players can choose to start on any one of the first three stages and the game features 14 different possible endings.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : TA-0032[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 14 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 12 Khz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 320 x 256 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 16384[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Shadow Force was released in June 1993.[CR]The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Metamorphosis Ninja'.[CR]A Technos billboard featuring Kunio appears at the start of the Construction stage.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The Japanese version is different from the US Version :[CR]- The game's sequence in attract mode are different.[CR]- During the attract mode, you can see the events that bring the Dr. Wong and his evil organization 'Theaser' to menace the world. In the US version this sequence has been cut.[CR]- There's a characters description during the attract mode.[CR]- You can use only 3 keys in the game : one for punch, one for kick and one for jump, to possess an enemy press A+B when your close to him, and press A+B+C to execute the special attack.[CR]- The enemies are more easily to beat, even the bosses suffer much damage (so, the game is a little bit easier)[CR]- The Bonus Stage after each stage has been cut on the Japanese version.[CR]- The standard color of the Coyote character is different.[CR]The US version has at usual the 'winners don't use drugs' logo during the attract mode.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* To possess an enemy, go close on him, then press the 6th button, now you can use that enemy like a playable character, and you can use his moves too! (a screen appears with a description of one of the enemy moves). For leave the enemy body and return to your normal character hero, press the same key. Try to control different enemies and have fun to switch on them!! Find what of them are most powerful and how you can take advantage of their moves! Remember that you can't possess a boss, and also you can't possess nobody if your lifebar is empty; also, when the enemy possessed dies, the player is still on action, but is lifebar remains empty.[CR]* When you engage an enemy, you fight still versus one of them, and in that moment you can go back and forward on him without turn your shoulder on him, you can also execute a block when the enemy attack simply press the opposite direction on him. If you engage groups of enemies, you fight one enemy at once, while the others stay far of you waiting that you defeat the first enemy before they attack you.[CR]* After you've beaten the last boss, Dr Wong will challenge you giving the chance of one last battle before you can terminate the game : this final battle is identical to the bonus stage, but you can choose one of the 4 boss to fight versus the other character boss controlled by CPU. This is the only moment on the game where you can control a boss. If you win this last battle you can see the real final of the game, if you lose you'll obtain a game over.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Planner : Toshinari Takahashi[CR]Object Designers : Seiichirou Ishiguro, Koji Ogata, Michiaki Ishida, Kosei Okamoto, Makoto Shirai, Long Hair Mori, Inemuri Nakamura, Hideki Hoshiya, Manabu Taniguchi[CR]Background Designer : Shinichi Saito, Kuni Bayashi, Kozukuri Ohsumi, Hiroyuki Kato, Yasuhiro Ohi, Takayuki Ozawa[CR]Programmers : Tatsumi Saitoh, T.

				<title_clean>Beat Em Up - The Simpsons - 4 Player</title_clean>
				<plot>The Simpsons (c) 1991 Konami.[CR]A jewel heist gone wrong sees Mr Burns's sidekick, Smithers, kidnapping Maggie and making his escape. Between one and four players take on the role of either Homer, Marge, Lisa, or Bart in this colorful, horizontally-scrolling beat-em-up from Konami. Each Simpsons character possesses an attacking move specific to them; Marge is armed with a vacuum cleaner, Lisa has a skipping rope, Bart has his skateboard, and Homer fights with his fists. The players must battle their way through a variety of Simpsons-themed levels - such as Springfield and Krustyland - fighting goons, thugs, zombies, drunks, firemen, and several Simpsons regulars. Many Simpsons characters that don't appear as enemies have 'cameo' scenes in the game (Otto working at a burgerstand in Krustyland, for example). The archetypal 'boss' character awaits the players at the end of every stage. The game ends with a final showdown with the evil Mr. Burns in his luxurious mansion.[CR]The Simpsons was designed to Konami's typically-high production standards and was, like the 'Ninja Turtles' games that appeared a couple of years' earlier, very faithful to its source material. The colorful, smoothly-animated sprites captured the spirit of the legendary cartoon superbly, and the game's many humorous touches were timed to perfection.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]There were several distinct versions of this game available in the arcade, the 4-player dedicated cabinet, the 4-player conversion kit (designed to retrofit "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles", but a lot of them ended up on "Gauntlet" machines too), and the 2-player conversion kit (designed to retrofit almost anything). The only real difference in game-play between versions was the maximum amount of players. The Simpsons dedicated cabinet was fairly large and had an over-sized control panel (to accommodate 4 players). The sides were decorated with painted side-art showing all five members of the Simpsons family scampering around (Homer seems to be stepping on the tail of the family cat). Some cabinets may have this same scene as a large sticker, instead of it being painted on. American machines are usually blue in color, while the European ones were usually white. The marquee shows a family photo and has a 'The Simpsons' logo done in yellow. The control panel repeats the graphics from the marquee and has 4 joysticks (one for each player), each of which is a different color. Different Simpsons machines will have different sized monitors, although 25" and 32" were the most popular sizes available. [CR]Game ID : GX072 [CR]Main CPU : KONAMI (@ 3 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), K053260 (@ 4 Mhz) [CR]Players : 4 [CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick [CR]Buttons : 2 [CR]= &gt; Attack, Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]The Simpsons was released in April 1991. [CR]This video game is based on the prime-time animated series of the same name created by Matt Groening. [CR]The Simpsons and "Aliens" arcade machines can be seen in the background of the 'Moe's Tavern Stage'. Ever wonder why the Aliens arcade game makes a cameo appearance in The Simpsons? It turns out that both The Simpsons tv show and Aliens (the movie) are made by 20th Century Fox (and of course, Konami got the rights to make the arcade games for both franchises). [CR]Some stuff related to the TV series : [CR]* In the character profiles, Lisa is said to be age 7. In the TV series, she is 8 years old. [CR]* In the Character profile, Homer's age is 35. His real age is 36. Konami goofed that one. [CR]* Bart wears a blue shirt in this game. In the series, he normally wears an orange shirt. The blue-shirted Bart appeared on various T-shirts and other Simpsons merchandise. This was even referenced in one episode of the series. Homer was waving Lisa (who wears a red dress) around to attract a bull's attention. Then Homer says 'Now for some calming blue', and reaches for Bart. Seeing that Bart is wearing an orange shirt, he says 'Where's your blue shirt?'. Bart replies, 'I don't have a blue shirt'. [CR]* In some parts of the game, the bow in Maggie's hair is pink. Other times, it is the correct blue color. [CR]* The rabbit characters that appear in various places in the game are from Matt Groening's comic strip, 'Life in Hell'. [CR]* Smithers is much more evil in this game than he has ever been in the show. In the series, Smithers is (as Burns himself put it) 'the sober Yin to [Burns'] raging Yang'. In this game he is depicted as a cape-wearing, bomb-throwing psycho. Smithers' voice is wrong - Smithers is colored wrong. The color scheme used in this game appears to be based on the episode 'Homer's Oddysey', in which Smithers was colored incorrectly. In this episode, his skin color was also incorrect : instead being yellow, it was a dark pink color. Also, Smithers has never worn a cape, as he does in this game (Perhaps he has an evil twin who is a cape-wearing mad bomber!). [CR]* Mr. Burns' voice also sounds wrong, except when he says 'Excellent'. The 'Excellent' voice sample was taken directly from the show and the rest of the lines were recorded by a different actor. [CR]* SPOILER ALERT! : After Mr. Burns has been defeated, his eyes turn into Xs as he is lying on the ground. In the series Bart's eyes were drawn as Xs in a dream sequence, when Bart was imagining that school bully Nelson Muntz had beaten him to death and the school nurse had reconstructed his face for his funeral. [CR]* In this game Sideshow Bob helps you by giving you food that restores your health. Since a first season episode where he framed Krusty the Klown for armed robbery and his plans were foiled by the Simpson kids, he is normally a villain. It seems that this game was made before the first season was finished (Or at least the people who worked on the game hadn't seen all of the episodes yet). [CR]* The 'Moe's Tavern' stage in this game does not look much like it's TV counterpart. In this game it seems to be underground and only accessible by hidden elevators (One of the elevators is in a fake 'Krusty' grave in the cemetary stage, the other in a wall of rock in the 'Springfield Butte' stage). Of course, in the series it is just a regular building with a regular door that people walk through off the street. [CR]* In this game, Barney's hair color is the same color as his skin (yellow). He appeared this way in a few early episodes of the first season, but later his hair was colored brown and only the Simpson kids have hair that is the same color as their skin. [CR]* Channel 6 (Stage 7) : The anchorman in this stage is the same one that appears in the episode 'Call of the Simpsons'. In that episode, this anchorman sounds just like Kent Brockman, but looks completely different. The anchorman's hair was colored gray in the episode, but in this game the anchorman is colored like Scott Christian (Early on in the series, an anchor named Scott Christian would frequently be 'filling in for Kent Brockman', the regular anchorman. Eventually Christian was dropped from the series and they just used Kent Brockman). This anchorman is neither Kent Brockman or Scott Christian. If you stand in front of the anchorman, he will get mad. If you jump up on the anchor's desk, he will shrug his shoulders. [CR]In Stage 7, in the scene where you fight ninjas, the sign reads 'kabuki'. [CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game (4-Player model, serial number: 072251). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]* In the Japanese version, there are nuclear bombs laying around that can be thrown at enemies (for example, in front of the Noiseland Arcade in the first level). These bombs are not present in the other versions. These bombs look the same as the ones Mr. Burns shoots at you on the last level.[CR]* In the Japanese version, you can fill you life meter past full. For example, if your life meter is already full and you get an item that restores your health, you get no benefit in the non-Japanese versions. But in the Japanese version, you will get additional health points, indicated in the meter by a different color (When the life meter is full, it is purple. When it goes past full, the additional health is shown in yellow).[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Main programmer : A.

				<plot>Spider-man - The Video Game (c) 1991 Sega.[CR]A sideways scrolling beat-em-up for 1 to 4 players; choosing from Spider-Man, Black-Cat, Hawkeye or Sub-Mariner. The heroes must fight their way through four levels of Dr. Doom's villains; including Venom, The Scorpion, The Lizard, The Green Goblin, The Sandman, The Kingpin, The Hobgoblin, Electro, Dr. Octopus and, of course, Dr. Doom himself.[CR]Each player character has a different weapon or power that can be used throughout the game while fighting. Spider-Man uses his webs, The Black Cat uses her 'cat's claw' grappling hook and cable, Hawkeye uses his bow and arrows and The Sub-Mariner uses his hydro-electric charges. The game's viewpoint pans in and out between alternate large and small scale (4-way scrolling) sections. The game's 'camera' zooms out on alternate levels with the zoomed-out view introducing four-way scrolling platform sections to the gameplay. The game ends when the fourth and final chapter has been completed.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 833-8331-05[CR]Runs on the Sega "System 32" hardware.[CR]Players: 4[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in September 1991.[CR]All 4 superheroes in this game made their debuts in the following books : Sub-Mariner in Motion Picture Funnies Weekly #1, April 1939, Spider-Man in Amazing Fantasy #15, August 1962, Hawkeye in Tales of Suspense #57, September 1964, and Black Cat in Amazing Spider-Man #194, July 1979.[CR]Some of the tunes used in Spider-Man - The Video Game, are actually remixed tunes from Sega's 1986 arcade game, "Quartet".[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version is slightly different, it has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Splatterhouse (c) 1988 Namco.[CR]In a dark and stormy night, Rick and his girlfriend Jeniffer take refuge in the creepy West mansion, only to find himself dead and Jeniffer missing! Now, a mysterious sacrificial mask with amazing powers brings him back from the dead and in order to free himself from its curse, he must destroy the evil lurking deep within the mansion and save Jennifer in the process! Features some of the goriest graphics ever seen at its release date, awesome music &amp; sound effects, lots of the typical toys seen in horror flicks (knives, etc.) as well as lots of challenge![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Namco System 1 hardware[CR]Game ID : SH[CR]Main CPU : 6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Sub CPU : 6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : 6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]MCU: HD63701 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.57958 Mhz), Namco advanced 8-channel stereo WSG, stereo DAC[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 288 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.61 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 24-bit RGB palette[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Splatterhouse was released in November 1988.[CR]Licensed to Atari Games for distribution in the USA (February 1989). Only 100 PCBs were produced by Atari because the game was banned in most arcades in the USA due to its violent nature as well as some questionable bosses such as the chapel boss (The inverted cross). Splatterhouse was the first game to get a parental advisory disclaimer.[CR]Rick makes a cameo appearance in "Point Blank 3".[CR]Splatterhouse's developers seem to have been inspired by many known and a few lesser known horror flicks such as...[CR]* Friday the 13th movies : The third boss wears a bag for a mask just like Jason Voorhees did on the first three movies and Rick's mask resembles the well-know hockey mask that Jason wears in the later movies of the series until the Jason X movie in which he gets a totally different new look.[CR]* Evil Dead movies : Many concepts were borrowed from these particular movies such as : House deep within the woods where a famed scientist unleashes some very evil demonic power; The fight between Rick and his evil twins; The evil severed hands that even taunt him; The possessed room with flying furniture; The necromancer's zombies that just won't die, Rick's quest to rescue Jennifer, only to find her possessed and turned into a cackling demon hungry for his blood![CR]* The Exorcist : When fighting against demon Jennifer, she recovers her sanity for a few brief moments and begs for your help just before turning into a demon once again, something quite similar is seen in this horror classic.[CR]* H-man : The sludge monsters seen in the sewer levels seem somewhat similar to the liquid people seen in this old japanese horror flick.[CR]* Poltergeist : The possessed room may also have been inspired by this movie.[CR]* Parasite : The leeches seen at the end of the first stage as well as in many other later levels are cleary based on the creatures seen in this pseudo 3-D movie.[CR]* Rejuvenator : The big headed monsters whose heads fly off and attack before dying are very reminiscent of the gruesome brain-eating monster seen in this film.[CR]* Re-Animator : Dr. West is largely believed to be Herbert West who was featured prominently in H.P. Lovecraft's story Herbert West : Reanimator, who was subsequently featured in the "Re-Animator" film series.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Winning Run : G.S.M. Namco 2 - D24B1003) on 21/07/1989.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Slide Kick : Rick's most powerful attack is also the trickiest move to do in the game! Do a big jump (hold the jump button) while walking either left or right, then as Rick comes down from the jump hold diagonally down-left or down-right and press the attack button JUST BEFORE Rick's feet touch the ground. Use this move to take out many enemies at once and to quickly reach a level's exit but be sure not to slide right into a trap such as a pit, an acid puddle, etc.! [CR]* Reaching The Exit Is More Important Than Fighting! : When you are close enough to the end of a level, Rick will automatically walk towards the exit and he becomes completely invulnerable to any incoming enemy attack![CR]* Save Your Ammo! : You can only use your weapons while standing or jumping. This means you are free to low kick or slide kick your enemies in order to save your weapons for tougher enemies in a particular level. Also each time you pick another weapon, Rick will drop the previous weapon slightly ahead of him allowing you to pick it up again. This is particularly useful against the third stage's boss since you'll be able to easily blow him away with two shotguns![CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Splatterhouse (1988)[CR]2.

				<plot>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles &#12473;&#12540;&#12497;&#12540;&#20096;&#24525;&#32773;  (c) 1989 Konami.[CR](Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Super Kame Ninja)[CR]A sideways scrolling beat-em-up in which up to four players can choose to play as either 'Leonardo' (blue, katana blades), 'Raphael' (red, sais), 'Michaelangelo' (orange, nunchakas) or 'Donatello' (purple, bo staff) as the infamous turtles fight against the might of Shredder's army to try and rescue 'April O'Neil' and 'Splinter', before a final confrontation with their arch-enemies 'Krang' and 'The Shredder'.[CR]Ninja Turtles featured just two buttons - for 'Jump' and 'Attack' - making for simple and immediate gameplay. Visually the game made great use of its license and perfectly captured the spirit of both the original comic-book and cartoon series upon which it was based. The game also featured a 'buy-in' option, meaning that new players could join in at any time.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX963[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), Konami K007232 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), UPD7759 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 304 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 1024[CR]Players: 4[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Super Turtle Ninja'.[CR]Export releases:[CR]This game is known outside Japan as "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" and in UK as "Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles".[CR]This game was based on the first season of the original 1989 cartoon show.[CR]The Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles were created by Kevin Eastman and Peter Laird in 1984 and published by Mirage Studios. The whole idea for the comic book (which was originally published in Black and White) came from the nickname 'Ninja Turtle' that one of the creators had when they were young.[CR]In 1987, Playmates Toys bought the rights of the characters to produce a line of Action Figures. That same year Playmates made a TV adaptation of the story for a 5-episode mini series which became a huge success. Two years later, the series went on full production and was aired on CBS stations from 1989 to 1996 (with brief hiatus in 1993-1994).[CR]The success of this 'Humanoid Action Animal' concept spawned (or shed some light on) many other comics, toys and TV shows such as Bucky O'Hare, Swat Kats, C.O.W. Boys of Moo Mesa, Street Sharks, Biker Mice from Mars among others; most of them became complete blunders.[CR]After the first series was cancelled other shows based on these characters appeared, such as, Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation (Saban Productions, Live Action), Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and TMNT Fast-Forward. However, the 1980's craze never took off again.[CR]Konami hit the jackpot with this game. It was so successful that Konami went on a license-acquiring craze. They got the rights to many American (and some European) TV shows and Comic Books for home and arcade videogames with a quality so good that sometimes shadowed the original work.[CR]This game is mainly based in the first 5 episode mini-series. However, it contains some references to the original comic book. The opening scene is a mix between a scene in the TV show in which a building is raided by the TMNT to find for the first time the Technodrome and a scene of the comic book in which Shredder sets fire to April's building when he finds she's harboring the turtles (that scene was also taken for the movie). At the Parking Lot scene, there is a van that has the logo of TCRI. TCRI (or TGRI in the movie) was the company responsible for the mutagen; in the TV show, it was Shredder's invention.[CR]The first names of turtles; Michaelangelo, Raphael, Leonardo, and Donatello, are the names of Italian Renaissance artists who lived between 1386 and 1564. Three of those artists had full names which were respectively Michaelangelo Buonariti, Raphael Sanzio and Leonardo Da Vinci; but as for Donatello, that was his only name.[CR]In the ending epilogue, Konami spell Dimension X : 'Dimention X'.[CR]Soundtrack Releases :[CR]Konami Special Music Senryo-Bako Heisei 3 Nen-Ban (KICA-9005~8) (December 21, 1990)[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Various Sewer Level Tricks :[CR]1) When fighting in the sewer level, move your character as close as you can to the edge of the stone floor without falling to the water. If done correctly, no enemy in this level including the boss can touch you here as long as you remain on the floor's edge![CR]2) Stand just below the ledge in the middle of the screen. Then jump straight up. You will land just on the edge of the upper level. Nothing can hurt you for the rest of that level, but you can kill anything that comes close enough to you (You can't move up or down though, or you'll have to repeat this trick).[CR]3) You can keep from getting hit by walking right along the edge of the brick floor. This prevents enemies from attacking you from multiple directions. You still need to nail enemies directly in front of you or behind you. This is easy with Donatello.[CR]* You can theoretically get unlimited points. Use the yellow guy's boomerang. Lead one yellow guy in such a way that he gets stuck at an object (fire hydrant or barrel) between you and him, aligned horizontally. He will try to move toward you, but he won't be able to move since the object is near him. Get close enough to him so that he starts throwing boomerangs. You can kill each one for (wow!) 1 point.[CR]* Killing most bosses consist of 3 strategies : They all consist of moving vertically towards the bosses.[CR]1) Move vertically upwards, hit the boss, and move vertically downwards. Repeat until dead. Works well on Bebop.[CR]2) Wait for the boss to move vertically down towards you, wait for him, hit him, and move vertically upwards. Repeat until he's dead. Works best on Rocksteady. Best results occur when you hit and run at the same time.[CR]3) Wait for the boss to move vertically towards you. Jump over him, move through him and attack as you do this, keep moving. Repeat. Works well on the big robots.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Super Kame Ninja (1989)[CR]2.

				<plot>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles - Turtles in Time (c) 1991 Konami Industry Company, Limited.[CR]The sequel to 1989's hugely successful original, 'Turtles in Time' once more sees the four heroes taking on Shredder and his army. Gameplay remains similar to the original game, but the experience is enhanced further with the obligatory improved graphics and sound effects. 'Turtles in Time' also features a larger variety of levels, as now the battle between good and evil rages across time as the Turtles travel to prehistoric, pirate and Wild West times in their pursuit of the elusive Splinter. [CR]Yet again, Konami's mastery of the genre was in evidence as the manic energy and humour of the cartoon and comic-book series upon which the game is based was captured perfectly.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX063[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), K053260 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 [Attack, Jump][CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Turtles in Time was released in March 1991. [CR]This is the only franchise of the so-called 'Ameri-comi Connection' series that had an arcade sequel. [CR]Just like the previous game, it has references which don't come from the TV show in which is mainly based upon. The enemies at 'Skull &amp; Crossbones', Rhazar and Tokka, are the two mutants that Shredder creates to destroy the TMNT in the second movie and the Super Shredder form at 'Technodrome: The Final Shell Shock' also comes from the movie when he tries the mutagen on himself.

				<plot>Vigilante (c) 1988 Irem Corp.[CR]A sequel to Irem's legendary 1984 beat-em-up, "Kung-Fu Master", Vigilante sees the hero's girlfriend, Madonna, kidnapped by a gang of thugs and driven away in the back of their van. The vigilante must fight through five enemy-packed levels to rescue his girlfriend. As with "Kung-Fu Master", a tough guardian enemy awaits the player at the end of each level. The guardians must be defeated as quickly as possible as their energy bars will replenish in between the player's attacks.[CR]A weapon, in the form of Nunchakas, can occasionally be found and picked-up; adding to the player's 'kick' and 'punch' fighting moves. Some of the game's many enemies are also armed, with either clubs, chains, knives or guns. The game ends once Madonna is rescued.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579645 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579645 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579645 Mhz), DAC[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (PUNCH, KICK)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Vigilante was released in February 1988.[CR]Licensed to Data East for US manufacture and distribution.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Beat Em Up - Violent Storm</title_clean>
				<plot>Violent Storm (c) 1993 Konami Company, Limited.[CR]Violent Storm is a sideways-scrolling beat-em-up for up to three players set in the aftermath of World War III. The survivors of the war are attempting to rebuild their world but are being terrorised by violent gangs . Three vigilante heroes called 'Boris', 'Wade' and 'Kyle' are trying to protect the citizens but are hampered in their efforts by the evil and corrupt 'GELD' gang. As the heroes are patrolling the streets, they see their friend, Sheena, kidnapped by the gang. The vigilantes must fight through seven enemy-packed stages to rescue their friend and destroy the gang.[CR]As well as the standard punch and kick moves, each character also has a special attack. This move is powerful enough to fell several enemies at once, but with the trade-off that each time a special attack is executed, some of the player's health is lost. Health levels can be replenished by finding the food that lies hidden in breakable crates and barrels. [CR]Some of the gang members will drop a weapon when they are felled. These weapons can then be picked up and used by the players. Destructible crates and barrels also contain weapons and random bonus items. Stunned enemies fall to the ground and can still be attacked while prone.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID: GX168[CR]Main CPU: Motorola 68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU: Zilog Z80 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips: (2x) K054539 (@ 48 Khz)[CR]Players: Up to 3 simultaneously.[CR]Control per player: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons per player: 2 [CR]=&gt; Attack, Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Violent Storm was released on July 26, 1993.

				<title_clean>Beat Em Up - Warrior Blade - Rastan Saga Episode III</title_clean>
				<plot>Warrior Blade - Rastan Saga Episode III (c) 1991 Taito Corp.[CR]Warrior Blade is a fantasy-themed hack-and-slash game for one or two players, featuring both horizontal and vertically scrolling levels. Unlike previous Rastan games that featured only Rastan himself, players can now choose to play as one of three different warriors: Rastan, Dewey (a hireling) or Sophia (a thief).[CR]Players must then fight their way through a multitude of enemy-packed levels set in a variety of different locations, such as castles, a forest, a swamp and on board a sinking ship. Certain levels also have the players riding on animals, such as horses and dragons. Coins and treasure items can be found in the numerous barrels and chests that litter the levels, as well as being dropped by some defeated enemies. Bonus points and "vitality" - depending on the amount of treasure collected - are awarded upon the level's completion.[CR]As well as coins and treasure, other bonus items can be found that give weapon and magical-weapon power-ups, as well as extra vitality (health).[CR]Level progression through the game is not linear. After the very first level, "Depon Road", players are presented with a map of the Kingdom, and can choose which of four different routes they wish to take next. The available routes are; Castle (Northwest), Tower (Northeast), Ship (Southwest) and Palace (Southeast).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Prom Stickers: D24 [CR]Main CPU: Motorola 68000 @ 16MHz [CR]Sound CPU: Zilog Z80 @ 4MHz [CR]Sound Chips: YM2610, (4x) Volume [CR]Players: 2 [CR]Control: 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons: 2 (SWING/FIRE, JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Warrior Blade was released in May 1992 in Japan (even if the title screen says 1991).[CR]Unlike other games running on the Darius 2 Twin Screen hardware, Warrior Blade has a slightly different GFX set for the 2nd screen, as the game's programmers ran out of scr GFX space.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is relatively hard since there are a lot of things you can get points for. Also, some enemies require more then one hit to finish them off. Here is the scoring table :[CR]Archers : 100 Points[CR]Bird : 300 Points[CR]Copper Coin : 10 Points[CR]Gold Coin : 100 Points[CR]Lizard Soldiers : 700 Points[CR]Lizards : 250 Points[CR]Lizards with clubs : 250 Points[CR]Natives : 200 Points[CR]Plants : 50 Points[CR]Priests : 200 Points[CR]Shark : 350 Points[CR]Silver Coin : 50 Points[CR]Soldier on Dragon : 100 Points[CR]Soldiers : 250 Points[CR]Swordmen : 100 Points[CR]Treasure : 500 Points[CR]Undead (Mummies) : 100 Points[CR]Wizard : 200 Points[CR]You also get points for clearing an area. In addition, you will also get a time bonus of the time remaining x 100. The only two areas you don't get the time bonus added on are Horseman's Forest and Wind Canyon.  The clear bonuses are as follows :[CR]DEPON RD : 1,000 points[CR]HORSEMAN'S FOREST : 5,000 points[CR]WIND CANYON : 5,000 points[CR]All other areas are 10,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Round Select Mode :[CR]1) Hold Service Switch button, then reset the game.[CR]2) Press : Service(x3), Start, Service, on displayed 'Service Switch Error' message.[CR]3) Enter Round Select Mode in case of success.[CR]* The Bosses : There are seven bosses to deal with in this game. They are known as 'Area Guard' in the game. Here is the list with a couple of strategies :[CR]KING ZANANSTAFF : After you break through the tower floor, you will be deposited in a throne room. In front of your character will sit a skeletal man on a throne. After a few seconds of powering up, the battle will begin.[CR]1) There are a couple of threats you must deal with against this boss.[CR]a) The first threat is from the boss. He likes to throw blue fireballs at your character. They are easy to sidestep but are still a nuisance.[CR]b) The second threat is from above. Skulls fall from the ceiling. After a couple of seconds, they form into skeleton warriors. Usually there are three to four around at any time. They can cause a lot of problems, especially when you are closing on King Zananstaff.[CR]2) You first need to let the king throw his fireball and step away from it. Once he has done that, close on him real rapidly (unless you have a ranged weapon) and start pounding on him. You will know when your hits are registering because he will light up.[CR]3) When he gets ready to throw another fireball (he will cock his arm back), get away from him and sidestep it. Also, by this time, you will have to deal with the skeleton warriors. It only takes one hit to bring them down but they could block your path and keep you in the fireballs path.[CR]4) Repeat the above pattern until the king is destroyed. It should take 20 hits to bring him down.[CR]PYLEX = PYLON : After you complete your trek to the top of the spiral tower, this boss awaits. A fire will start and this boss will appear. He is skeletal looking with a demons head. Plus, he is on fire.[CR]1) When this boss appears, get outside of his range. He has a pretty long reach so you will need to jump around and move constantly.[CR]2) You won't get hurt by just running by him but if he hits you, be prepared for a big energy loss.[CR]3) One of his favorite tactics is to jump up and imprison your character within his flaming rib cage. This also can do some heavy-duty damage.[CR]4) The best way to take out this boss is to watch his hand on your side. When he raised it, go in and start hacking away at his rib cage. You will know your hits are registering because he will briefly turn blue.[CR]5) After a couple of hits, he will jump up. Watch the shadow on the ground since that is an indicator of his impact point. Run or jump out of the way and continue the above pattern of slashing and backing off.[CR]6) It takes 16 hits to turn this flaming skeleton into kindling.[CR]FINSTERNIS : Well, you couldn't go through a few bosses without having to deal with one knowledgeable in the mystic arts. Finsternis brings that reality to you. He appears as a robed man.[CR]1) This battle opens up with Finsternis creating five rocks that go in orbit around him. You need to quickly break up these rocks or he will launch them at your character.[CR]2) After you have busted the rocks, Finsternis will disappear and reappear on the other side of the screen.  At the same time, he will launch two attacks : Scrolls and fire. The scrolls attack is just a bunch of scrolls being thrown at your character and it doesn't do a whole lot of damage. It's the mini fireballs that can do some serious damage.[CR]3) After taking out the rocks, there is a slight delay before Finsternis disappears. Get some shots in on him. Again, he will briefly light up when you hit him.[CR]4) When he reappears, be prepared for the scroll and fire bombardment. As soon as its finished, go in and unload upon him some more. If you managed to get enough hits the first time, this should finish him off. If not, he will disappear and reappear attacking with scrolls and fire from another location.[CR]5) 16 hits will help this boss become part of the mystical universe.[CR]DESMOSTYLUS : This is one of the harder bosses to deal with. The reason is the fact you don't deal directly with the boss initially, but deal with the minions he creates.[CR]1) After he has settled in his floating throne, he will create five water dragons. They look like snakes but have dragon heads. They will go in and out of the water and aim for your character.[CR]2) In order to score hits on Desmostylus, you have to destroy his water dragons. There are usually three or four at any given moment until you have destroyed 16 of them. This isn't easy since they have the tendency to cover each other so if you get a shot on one, at one or two will have a shot at your character. This will definitely require a lot of maneuvering around so you don't get trapped. Once you have dispatched 16, all you need to do is give the boss a good whack.[CR]3) After that, the rest is history as the boss gets committed to a watery grave.[CR]PAS=DE=DAUX : Another skeletal boss but one with a new twist. This one has two heads, one human and the other demonic. In addition, instead of hands, he has blades at the ends of his four arms.[CR]1) This boss doesn't actually have any real surprises, he uses his four blades to deadly effect and also tries to corner your character against the side of the screen.[CR]2) The best way to take out this boss is to wait until the arm is raised on your characters side. Then rush in and get a couple of good shots. Keep in mind, only the end of your weapon can do damage so don't crowd in too close to this boss.[CR]3) Keep up the pattern and jump to the other side if you don't have room to maneuver on the side you're on.[CR]4) One thing to keep in mind, after you get 14 hits on this boss, he will fall apart. Don't let this fool you though, he isn't finished yet. You still will need to get two more hits to totally finish this boss off.[CR]GIFFKRAKE : When you get to the other end of the ship, this boss awaits you. He will only briefly appear human before he transforms into a mutated octopus.[CR]1) This boss doesn't move but his tentacles have a long range and can tag you for some big damage.[CR]2) In order to get hits on this boss, you must first get through his tentacles. It only takes 4 hits to take a tentacle out but keep in mind that the other five tentacles will be gunning for your character. In addition, the tentacles will reattach to Giffkrake so you must be quick.[CR]3) Once you have broken through the tentacle barrier, start beating on the main body. You may have to back off to deal with the tentacles.[CR]4) Keep up this pattern. After 16 hits, Giffkrake will be seafood.[CR]LORD LUDERKAWN : This boss starts out as an armored warrior. Don't let that fool you because he soon turns into a demon.[CR]1) This boss is pretty quick and it will take all of your skill to maneuver around to get hits in on him.[CR]2) In addition, he has a nasty little breath weapon that can do major damage if your character is in its path.[CR]3) Again, the best way to hit this boss is to ''dance'' around him. Get a couple of hits and maneuver away before he has a chance to counterstrike.[CR]4) Continue to move in and out getting in hits if you can.  After 16 hits, you can say bye-bye to the boss as he transforms back into the armored warrior.[CR]This game consists of an introductory and final area. In between are four areas and subareas you can choose from. You can choose any area that you haven't been through already. First, though, there are some basic strategies one must be aware of before playing the game.[CR]* Remember, you can move in eight directions on the screen. So if an enemy is in front of you, you can sidestep around that enemy and possibly can get a shot from the side or rear.[CR]* A lot of times, enemies will come at you in a tightly packed group before they spread out.  Get in a hit while they are tightly packed and you can hit more then one in your one hit. This proves to be very valuable considering the fact that most enemies in this game require multiple hits to kill them. The difference between life and death could be that one extra hit.[CR]* Break open all barrels and crates along the way. There are many objects that can be of major use to your character. Items such as the Arms of Thunder which hits the enemy with a lightening bolt in addition to your regular hit. Healing potions to restore your vitality and actually to make you immune, for a time period, to enemy attacks. You also may find the crystal orb which allows you to have an indestructible wizard fight at your side. This is especially helpful when the screen is full of enemies.[CR]* When there are too many enemies to handle at once, sometimes jumping into the middle of the group and swinging wildly can do a lot of good. Since you know you will get a hit regardless of where you aim, you may be able to ''thin'' the herd and give yourself better odds in the process.[CR]* Each area has a timer attached to it. You can gain extra time by getting to specific parts of an area or by getting objects. You don't want to sit around too long in one area though. The enemy will not give up and continue to send in more troops to delay your movement even more. Sometimes a good strategy is to run. You run by double-tapping the joystick in the direction you wish to travel. Your run is only broken by an enemy or object in your way. You may not get as many points, but you can make it through levels quicker.[CR]* When you have the wizard with your character, the only way to regenerate magical energy is by picking coins and treasures. This basically means a lot of fighting and breaking up things. It is worth it, though, since the wizard has a very powerful arsenal of spells to assist your character.[CR]Now, we will go through each area and subarea you will have to go through to complete the game. You [CR]ill have 50 on the timer for each level. Again, this number may go up or down dramatically depending on what events or actions take place. Ok, let's go adventuring.[CR]DEPON ROAD : This is your introduction to this world. There aren't a whole lot of threats to deal with in this area.[CR]1) You will first be assaulted by eight plants. Usually an attack is powerful enough to take out two in one hit.[CR]2) Depending on how fast you move through this area, you may also encounter lizards and lizards with clubs.[CR]CASTLE : The castle area consists of two subareas. It is in these areas that you will encounter a big variety of enemies.[CR]HORSEMAN's FOREST : Your character will be on horseback for this area. The major threats are mounted soldiers and archers. In addition, fallen logs will be scattered on the road also for you to jump.[CR]1) The soldiers and archers are pretty easy to deal with. Just make sure you don't get in the line of fire of the archers since their arrows can cause your character some pain. The soldiers just swing their swords and attempt to hit your character.[CR]2) You can use your mount as a weapon in addition to the attack your character makes. If you can bump one of the enemy riders on their mount, it will then only take one hit, instead of two, to knock them down.[CR]3) When you see this character : ''!'', it means that get prepared to jump. If you fail to jump, your mount will stumble and your character will take damage.[CR]4) There will be 20 mounted archers and soldiers for your character to deal with.[CR]THE ENCHANTED CASTLE OF ZANASTAFF : [CR]1) You will first run into natives and priest before you even cross the bridge. They are easy to deal with, plus, if you're playing as Rastan, you will grab some and throw them.[CR]2) Continue down the corridor and you will be attacked by mummies and soldiers.[CR]3) Go up the stairs and attack the door to break it down. More enemy awaits, mostly soldiers and lizard soldiers.[CR]4) Make sure you break open the barrels since you can get either Arms of Fire or Thunder. They help greatly in thinning the enemy ranks. You will soon come upon an area that has three gaps bordered by three thin platforms. Be careful crossing over this area. In addition, birds holding rocks will appear to make your trip even more perilous.[CR]5) Jump on the chain and ride it to the top. Swing your sword before getting off the chain to take care of anybody too close to your landing spot.[CR]6) Continue down this path until you get to the end. The floor will collapse and you will deal with the Area Guard : King Zananstaff.[CR]7) When you defeat King Zananstaff, you will get the ''Crown of Ishulin''. This crown gives your character extra power in attacks.[CR]TOWER : The tower area consists of two subareas.[CR]WIND CANYON : In this subarea, you will be a dragon rider.  Major threats are just the[CR]mounted soldiers who try to knock you off your dragon.[CR]1) The soldiers are real easy to deal with in this subarea. You have a lot of room to move about and you should be able to knock them off their mounts with little trouble.[CR]2) Use your mount as a weapon. If a soldier is coming under your character, just bring your mount on top of him.[CR]MAHADIDEKARADI SPIRAL TOWER :[CR]1) This battle basically has you battling your way up a huge tower. The usual enemies abound to prevent your getting any higher.[CR]2) When you reach the top, the tower will catch on fire and Area Guard Pylex=Pylon will emerge to do battle.[CR]3) When you defeat him, the ''Moon Crystal'' is your reward. The crystal gives your character extra magic power.[CR]PALACE : The Palace area consists of two subareas.[CR]KA FA MOUNTAIN : You will start this level by sliding down a huge mountain. To make your slide even more fun, boulders and chasms will be in your way.[CR]1) Use the boulders to your advantage. You will only encounter lizard soldiers in this subarea. They pack themselves together pretty tightly so the boulders usually damage three or four of them. Makes your job a whole lot easier.[CR]2) When you see this character : ''!'', get ready to jump over a chasm. If you don't, then it's goodnight to your character.[CR]3) After getting to the bottom of the mountain, you will have to deal with a few lizards until you get to the Area Guard.[CR]4) When you defeat Finsternis, you will advance to the next subarea.[CR]PALACE OF THE BLACK DEMON RELIGION : This subarea has a lot of floor level traps. These traps are spears or blades coming in and out of the lower part of the wall.[CR]1) All manner of enemies will attack your character. You do, though, have extra help. This help is in the form of the traps that are along the floor. Cause your enemies to stay in those trapped areas and you won't have to do much in the way of killing them.[CR]2) By that same thought, don't get caught in these traps. They will drain your energy very quickly if you are getting hit by two to three at a time.[CR]3) You will go down two sets of chains to make it to the Area Guard Desmostylus.[CR]4) Once you have cleared out the Area Guard, your reward is ''Brave Geran's Necklace''. This necklace gives your character extra speed.[CR]SHIP : This area consists of two subareas.[CR]HARBOR VILLAGE OF PESLO : [CR]1) There are a lot of barrels and crates in this area. Make sure you break into all of them since there are a lot of good things to be had.[CR]2) The usual enemies are around to make your life more interesting. Deal with them accordingly.[CR]3) You will eventually come onto a pier. This is where you will battle the Area Guard Pas=De=Deux.[CR]4) When you have eliminated the Area Guard you will head to the next subarea.[CR]PIRATE SHIP SOUTHERNKID : When you enter the ship, the floor will be covered with water.

				<title_clean>Beat Em Up - X-Men - 4 Player</title_clean>
				<plot>X-Men (c) 1992 Konami.[CR]X-Men is a side-scrolling beat-em-up for up to four players. The X-Men's mission is to find and rescue Professor X, who has been captured by evil mutants and is now being held prisoner by Magneto.[CR]Each X-Man character has an 'Attack', 'Jump' and 'Mutant Power' button. The mutant power attack is a powerful special move unique to each X-Man. While it inflicts a lot of damage on the enemies, the trade-off is that each usage removes 3 bars from the players health meter (a full meter has 10 bars). Each level ends with a face-off against a powerful mutant boss character.[CR]The game has six stages, with the final one set on 'Asteroid M', Magneto's base. The defeated mutant bosses from the previous levels each make an appearance (albeit in a less powerful form) before the final encounter with Magneto himself.[CR]Players can chose from 6 X-Men characters, they are:[CR]Cyclops [CR]Colossus [CR]Wolverine [CR]Storm [CR]Nightcrawler [CR]Dazzler[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX065[CR][4-Player model][CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151, K054539[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; Attack, Jump, Mutant Power Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]X-Men was released in April 1992. [CR]X-Men is based upon the comic book series of the same name (most of the game's plot is loosely based on the 1989 X-Men cartoon called 'Pryde Of The X-Men'). Here are the debut comics for all Marvel characters from this game including non-playable characters : [CR]Cyclops (aka Scott Summers) - X-Men #1 [CR]Colossus (aka Piotr Nikolaievitch Rasputin) - Giant-Size X-Men #1 [CR]Wolverine (aka James 'Logan' Howlett) - Incredible Hulk #180 [CR]Storm (aka Ororo Munroe) - Giant Size X-Men #1 [CR]Nightcrawler (aka Kurt Wagner) - Giant Size X-Men #1 [CR]Dazzler (aka Alison Blaire) - X-Men #130 [CR]Professor X (aka Charles Francis Xavier) - X-Men #1 [CR]Shadowcat (aka Katherine 'Kitty' Pryde) - X-Men #129 [CR]The Sentinels - X-Men #14 [CR]Bonebreaker - Uncanny X-Men #229 [CR]Pyro (aka St. John Allerdyce - Level 1 boss) - Uncanny X-Men 141 [CR]The Blob (aka Fred J. Dukes - Level 2 boss) - X-Men #3 [CR]Wendigo (Level 3 boss) - Incredible Hulk #162 [CR]Master Mold (Level 4 boss) - X-Men #15 [CR]The White Queen (aka Emma Grace Frost - Level 5 Mid-Boss) - Uncanny X-Men #129 [CR]Juggernaut (aka Cain Marko - Level 5 boss) - X-Men #12 [CR]Mystique (aka Raven Darkholme - Level 7 boss) - Ms. Marvel #16 [CR]Magneto (aka Erik 'Magnus' Lehnsherr - Final boss) - X-Men #1 [CR]In Nightcrawler's ranking screen, his name is misspelled as 'Nightcrowler'. [CR]Although "Final Fight" set the standard for scrolling fighters. Konami's X-Men created several innovations for the genre, including the ability to hit fallen opponents to prevent them from getting back up, as well as a character-specialized 'mutant power', which could clear the screen of enemies, but also reduced the player's health. The game is fondly remembered by those who played it for its fun, addicting game-play and colorful graphics. However, it is also sometimes criticized for its wooden voice acting and often ungrammatical script ('I am Magneto, Master of Magnet'). [CR]Bill Toups holds the official official record for this game with 830 points on June 11, 2004. [CR]King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami All Stars 1993 - KICA-9016, 9018) on December 21, 1992. [CR]A X-Men unit appears in the 1998 movie 'The Replacement Killers'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Due to certain issues, both the 2-player and 4-player cabinets, a rare occurrence, had character selecting, while the 6-player cabinets forced the selections.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Chief Producer and Director : Lee[CR]Visual Designers : K.

However it's revealed that a Xenomorph which scares off a Space Mutant (a recurring movie franchise on the TV show) is reveals itself to be none other than Marge Simpson inside the Alien costume.[CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on April 24, 2009.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR]The Japanese version is very unlike any other version to appear in other countries :[CR]* Most obviously, both APC driving levels have been entirely deleted.[CR]* As such, the subplot of rescuing Newt is gone. Therefore, Newt never appears in Stage 1.[CR]* When you take on the 'Shrinky-Dink Alien Quartet', the first one to fully enlarge hops off-screen, leaving you to only battle the other three.[CR]* Many of the aliens, zombies, and mid-bosses can be killed with fewer shots.[CR]*Two new kinds of minor enemy appear in the game :[CR]a) An adult alien bursts out of the background wall during the vent portion of what we consider Stage 5. It functions much like the Ground-Poppers and is destroyed just as easily, but with new animations and from a different angle. It is the only one of its type in the game.[CR]b) The small form of the Shrinky-Dink Alien, as seen in the form of the second mid-boss in Stage 5, reappears in Stage 7. It stands alone on the catwalks with a ring of orange energy circling it and the catwalk in a kind of 'shield'. A few shots destroy it.[CR]* Titles have been given to each level. They are as follows, transcribed as they appear in the game.[CR]Level 1 - Living Quarters[CR]Level 2 - Factory[CR]Level 3 - Factory2[CR]Level 4 - Queen Alien's DEN[CR]Level 5 - Escape Route[CR]Level 6 - Battle Ship SULACO[CR]* Special weapons and bombs appear much more frequently in the game, dropping from the sky for the players to use at regular intervals.[CR]* It is now possible to attain 1-ups in the game. If a player is still carrying a weapon from the last special weapon power-up, the next one to fall on-screen will contain a 1-up. It comes in the form of a red ribbon with a bow wrapped around the word '1up'.[CR]* In addition to the other enemies in this section, ground-popping aliens now appear earlier, during the nest portion of what we know as Stage 3.[CR]* In addition to the other enemies, flying aliens now appear during the first power loader segment, in Stage 3.[CR]* Flying aliens are much more frequent throughout the outdoor portion of Stage 5 and Stage 7.[CR]* Extra exploding barrels appear throughout the game.[CR]* Numerous aliens have changed color. Adult aliens are now purple instead of maroon, face-huggers are now flesh-toned instead of green, etc.[CR]* Many of the adult aliens in the elevator sequence of Stage 3 have been removed. They have been replaced with flying aliens that do NOT damage the cables. This makes this sequence much easier.[CR]* The beams from the 3-Way gun have changed color from purple to orange.[CR]* During the final battle, the queen does NOT breathe fire/acid at you. Instead, after flashing white, she sends out multiple images of herself as a projectile! These are wider and therefore are easier to be hit by.[CR]* The queen charges at you constantly even if you are in the power loader. This makes the final battle much more difficult.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Game programmers: S. Okamoto, K. Ozaki, Hirotaka.I.1[CR]Character designers: Kengo N., Nishiyan[CR]Graphic designers: M.

				<plot>Alien Syndrome (c) 1987 Sega.[CR]Alien Syndrome is a overhead-view run and gun game for one or two players in which a number of Mankind's space ships and bases have been overrun by an alien race, who have taken the human inhabitants hostage.[CR]Players control two soldiers named Ricky and Mary and must fight their way through large eight-way scrolling levels to rescue their captured comrades. Once a set number of hostages have been rescued, an exit opens and players can pass through it to fight the end-of-level guardian. Once the guardian is defeated, play moves onto the next stage.[CR]A time-bomb is automatically set at the start of each stage, which must then be completed before the bomb's timer runs down. Failure to finish the level in time results in the death of the player characters. Weapon upgrades and maps of the current level are available at certain points and are accessed via hatchways in the wall.[CR]Alien Syndrome consists of 6 full stages plus a 7th final mini-stage, consisting solely of a fight to the death against the game's final, massive guardian.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "System 16A" hardware.[CR]Game ID: 317-0033[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Alien Syndrome was released in January 1987 in Japan.[CR]Alien Syndrome was sold in a dedicated cabinet by Sega, but was also sold as a conversion kit by Sun Corporation (licensed from Sega) for the America market only.[CR]Donn Nauert holds the record for this game with 2,269,200 points on February 2, 1988.[CR]Soundtrack releases :[CR][JP] October 10, 1987 - After Burner [Sega Game Music Vol.3] [28XA-109][CR]Legend of Game Music 2 - Platinum Box [Scitron Digital Contents - SCDC-00473 to 00482 - January 18, 2006][CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hint : Shoot and grab everything as quickly as possible.

				<plot>Avenging Spirit (c) 1991 Jaleco.[CR]While walking out with his girlfriend the game's hero is ambushed by unknown enemies who snatch his girlfriend and shoot the hero dead. Now, as a wandering spirit with the ability to possess almost anybody he comes across, the hero is summoned by his girlfriend's father and given a mission to save her from the mysterious crime syndicate that holds her hostage. Only then can the hero rest in peace.[CR]The player's character 'inhabits' a body with which to combat the game's enemies. When that body is killed, providing there is a living enemy nearby (other than that of a boss) the player can posses them and continue playing. Each time this is done, it costs the player some of their 'spirit energy'. Should the hero die when there are no enemies close by for the player to possess; the game is over.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Jaleco Mega System 1-B hardware[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 7 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.5 Mhz), (2x) OKI6295 (@ 30.303 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Fire, [B] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in May 1991.[CR]This game is known in Japan as "Phantasm".[CR]A Korean bootleg/hack of this game is known as "Monky Elf".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Good ending : you must find the three keys to unlock the door in which your girlfriend is held hostage in order to see the good ending.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Total Planner : Toku[CR]Game Designer : Myaa[CR]Programmer : T.

				<plot>Biomechanical Toy (c) 1995 Zeus.[CR]Biomechanical Toy is a colourful eightway-scrolling platform game set in a world of magically animated toys. The magical pendulum that animates the toys has been stolen by the evil 'Scrubby' - a criminal once imprisoned for trying to steal the pendulum who has managed to escape and take his revenge.[CR]Evil toys now patrol the kingdom and must be destroyed or avoided. Good toys have been trapped throughout the levels and if freed by Inguz, will give help by providing additional firepower for a short time.[CR]Inguz carries a basic, single-firing gun, although additional ammo clips can be found throughout the game that upgrade the gun with either extra shot power, automatic firing or exploding bullets. When the gun's current ammo clip is empty, Inguz will take a moment to reload, leaving him vulnerable to attack.[CR]Inguz begins each stage (and each new life) with a full health meter of eighty units, but food can be found that will boost the health meter. The player can lose a life either by running out of health, falling off the bottom of the screen, or running out of time. Clearing each stage awards bonus points based on both remaining time and health units.[CR]Checkpoints - indicated by red flags - are located at certain points throughout the stages. In the event of losing a life, the player will restart at the last checkpoint reached. Objects with Inguz's face on them (such as wooden chests and balloons) release bonus items when shot.[CR]An abstract, oriental-looking face occasionally forms part of a level's platform which, when shot, releases balloons which can in turn be shot for bonus items. A giant flying hat also occasionally appears and will drop bonus items when shot. Smart Bombs can also be found at certain points that, when run into by Inguz, will damage or destroy all enemy toys on screen.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 922804/2[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : OKI6295 (@ 8 Khz)[CR]Control per player: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons per player: 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]This is the first and only Coin Op produced by Zeus. In 1992 Zeus Software developed the Amiga game 'Risky Woods' (published by Dinamic, a spanish software house, very famous in the eighties on the computer market). Ricardo Puerto and Raul Lopez (see Staff section for more info) made some games (not always together) on the Amstrad CPC for Dinamic software in the eighties.[CR]Some of the game's music is sampled from various films such as 1985's Subway starring Christopher Lambert, 1992's Passenger 57 starring Wesley Snipes, and 1985's To Live and Die in LA starring Willem Dafoe and William Petersen.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Main design : Raul Lopez, Ricardo Puerto[CR]Program : Ricardo Puerto[CR]Computer Graphics : Raul Lopez[CR]Art &amp; Animation : Raul Lopez, Maite R.

				<plot>Bucky O'Hare (c) 1992 Konami Company, Limited.[CR]This beat'em up game is the story of a green rabbit named Bucky O'Hare and his crew fighting to save the 'Aniverse' (Like our universe, just in another dimension with different planets) from the invading Toads ruled by a computer system known as KOMPLEX.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX173[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151, K054539[CR]Players : 2 or 4[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; Shoot, Jump, Super Bomb[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Bucky O'Hare was released in September 1992, it is based on the short-lived cartoon aired in 1991. Originally based upon the comic book created by Larry Hama in 1978, this was the first serious competitor to the TMNT because it wasn't completely children-oriented and the comic book wasn't a TMNT wannabe. However, due to poor distribution of the TV show and financial problems with the producers the show couldn't see a second season.[CR]Several of the staff members went on to form the developer Treasure the following year. 'Escape Iuchi5' is Hiroshi Iuchi, the director of "Ikaruga" and "Radiant Silvergun". 'Gammer Kikuchi' is Tetsuhiko Kikuchi, the character director of "Guardian Heroes", and 'Star Hanzawa' is Norio Hanzawa, the composer for most of Treasure's games.[CR]Soundtrack Releases (for limited-edition) :[CR]Konami All-Stars 1993 ~ Music Station of Dreams (KICA-9016~8) December 24, 1992[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]In the U.S. version :[CR]* "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen added.[CR]* Extra lives are impossible to obtain.

				<title_clean>Run N Gun - Commando</title_clean>
				<plot>Commando (c) 1985 Capcom.[CR]Commando is a vertically scrolling shoot'em up in which the player takes on the role of a highly trained commando soldier called "Super Joe", who starts the game by being dropped off in a jungle by a helicopter. [CR]Joe's mission is to rescue captives and destroy the enemy bases and strongholds that appear at the end of each level, killing as many enemy soldiers as possible in the process. [CR]The end-of-level strongholds see waves of enemy soldiers ordered to attack by a cowardly officer, who immediately runs away. Shooting the fleeing officer earns the player bonus points. Along the way, players can attempt to free prisoners-of-war by shooting their enemy guard escorts as they are transported across the screen.[CR]Super Joe carries only two weapons: a limited-range machine gun with unlimited shots, and a limited supply of hand grenades. Extra grenades can be picked up as the player progresses through the levels.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) Yamaha YM2203 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Commando was released in May 1985. [CR]It was then licensed to Data East for US manufacture and distribution in July 1985. Commando was the first (and and only) game that Capcom licensed to Data East. [CR]This game is known in Japan as "Senjou no Ookami" (translates as 'Wolf of the Battlefield') and is known as "Space Invasion" for the West German marketplace. [CR]The main character is Super Joe from "Bionic Commando" and "The Speed Rumbler". [CR]Tim Balderramos holds the official record for this game with 10051200 points on July 5, 1986. [CR]Bandai released a boardgame based on this video game (same name) : A simple roll-and-move type game, with symbols on the board indicating what happens when you land on that spot. There are multiple choices on which direction to go, but not too much in the way of required thinking. There are many different boards that you progress through, each 'board' representing one 'stage' of the game. [CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Capcom Game Music - 28XA-94) on August 25, 1986.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* The arch bridge is a dangerous spot so watch for grenade attacks from above. Be careful of trucks and jeeps that may try to run over you. Do not fall into rivers or ponds. Trees, walls and other obstacles may be used for cover.[CR]* Here's a good way to kill enemy soldiers without going anywhere near them : at the end of each area, when the enemy soldiers are pouring out of the gate from their compound, move your commando to the bottom of the screen and shoot down. Your shots will come down from the top of the screen, killing the soldiers as they come out of the gate.[CR]* This tip will let you rack up big points and all the extra men you can : on the first stage, there is a cliff on the right-hand side of the screen. The enemy troops will jump off the end of this cliff and attack you. If you walk until the enemy troops START jumping off, and then stop, you can just stand there and keep killing them until you either get sick of playing or reach the maximum amount of extra men the game allows. If you plan on playing through the rest of the game you should stop as soon as you reach the maximum amount of extra men, as the longer you just sit there, the harder and faster the enemies become, making the rest of the game substantially more difficult.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Run N Gun - Contra</title_clean>
				<plot>??? (c) 1987 Konami.[CR](Contra)[CR]In 2631, a meteorite strikes the Galuga archipelago near New Zealand, carrying with it a dormant alien being. Two years later, a terrorist organization calling themselves Red Falcon takes over the island as part of their plot to invade the Earth. Bill Rizer and Lance Bean, of the Contra unit, are sent to the Oceania island to stop the evil threat.[CR]'Contra' is a hectic one or two player platform shoot-em-up featuring 10 stages. In addition to the standard side-view levels, there are also "3D maze" stages in which the player must proceed through a series of corridors inside an enemy base, destroying various sensors, in order to reach the core of the base.[CR]Each player's character is equipped with a semi-automatic machine gun with an unlimited amount of ammunition and can jump, move and fire in all eight cardinal directions. Players can also move and jump simultaneously while firing. Co-ordination of the character's movement is essential as a single hit from any enemy, bullet, or other hazard will instantly kill the player's character and also eliminate the current weapon from the player's inventory.[CR]As players fight their way through the enemy-packed levels, additional weapons can be collected. If the player loses a life, they will also lose any weapon power-up they were carrying. Available weapons are:[CR]Machine Gun: Auto-fire.[CR]Spread gun [S]: Allows the player to fire 5 shots in an arc.[CR]Laser: Will shoot a long laser that can take out many enemies in a row.[CR]Fire Ball [F]: A gun which fires small fireballs in a corkscrew pattern.[CR]Rapid Bullets [R]: Increases the firing rate of the player's currently equipped weapon. Works with the Machine Gun and Fire Ball.[CR]Barrier [B]: Will make the player invincible for a few seconds.[CR]The game consists of ten stages:[CR]Stage 01: Jungle (horizontal scroll)[CR]Stage 02: Inside Base 1 (3D maze)[CR]Stage 03: Core of Base 1 (3D fixed)[CR]Stage 04: Waterfall (vertical scroll)[CR]Stage 05: Inside Base 2 (3D maze)[CR]Stage 06: Core of Base 2 (3D fixed)[CR]Stage 07: Snow Field (horizontal scroll)[CR]Stage 08: Energy Zone (horizontal scroll)[CR]Stage 09: Hangar (horizontal scroll)[CR]Stage 10: Alien Lair (horizontal scroll)[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX633[CR]Main CPU: Motorola M6809 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU: Motorola M6809 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips: Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.582071 Mhz)[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2 [SHOOT, JUMP][CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Contra was released in February 1987.[CR]This game is known in Europe as "Gryzor".[CR]Note: The Japanese version uses kanji (Chinese characters) to phonetically spell out 'Kon-to-ra', the Japanese transliteration of the name "Contra". This is an example of ateji, in which an artist uses kanji for their phonetic value rather than any meaning they may have.[CR]Here are the official names of the characters: Bill Rizer (player 1) and Lance Bean (player 2). They were named after the following actors, all of which appeared in the 1986 movie, Aliens; Bill Rizer is named after the actors Bill Paxton and Paul Reiser, while Lance Bean is named after Lance Henriksen and Michael Biehn.[CR]Bill Rizer makes an appearance as a supporting character in the 1992 Family Computer game "Wai Wai World 2 SOS!! - Paseri Jou".[CR]The music from the final stage is also used for the final boss confrontation in "Wai Wai World" for the Family Computer.[CR]Chad Johnson holds the official record for this game with 1, 546, 600 points on July 15, 2002.[CR]Alpha Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Vol.4 - 28XA-201) on March 10, 1988.[CR]Literatures:[CR][JP] June 05, 1998; Contra [Konami Game Books Series 4][CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The game's backstory differs between sources. The storyline written above is the one used by Japanese sources and later mentioned in canon in Contra: Shattered Soldier for the PlayStation 2. In the North American manual for the NES version, the time was changed from the 27th century to the present day, with the location moved from Galuga to an unnamed South American island. Bill and Lance were given the codenames 'Mad Dog' and 'Scorpion', names which were later used for 2 unrelated characters in the American-produced Contra 4 for the Nintendo DS.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Weapons[CR]1) Shotgun: Your default weapon, can fire suprisingly fast.[CR]2) Spread Gun: Shoots waves of expanding blobs. Outstanding.[CR]3) Laser: Hold down fire for a longer beam. Powerful.[CR]4) Fireball: Fires spinning red blobs.[CR]5) Machine Gun: Rapid fire bullets. Sounds like a drum machine.[CR]6) Rapid: Speeds up shotgun, fireball &amp; machine gun bullets. Handy.[CR]7) Barrier: Complete invulnerability for a limited time. Nice.[CR]* Use shots wisely: Jump shots and crouch shots allow you to attack while avoiding enemy attacks. Do not hesitate. Keep those shots going![CR]* Kill before being killed: if you see an enemy, shoot right away. Defeat them before they fire at you. Be the first one to attack![CR]* Tip for taking down the fortress: At the end of Stage 1 (the Jungle) and Stage 4 (the Waterfall), you will find yourself at the heavily fortified entrance of the next base. To gain access to the base, you will need to destroy the large sensor. The sensor in Stage 1 is guarded by a sniper and two mortar cannons, while the sensor in Stage 4 is guarded by a large five-way cannon at middle, with two rotating guns around it (one on each side).[CR]* Tips for 3-D mazes: Destroy the orb-shaped sensors in each wall to stop the high voltage electric currents. Taking out the weak points quickly is key to conquering the 3-D levels before time runs out. [CR]If you press the joystick upward and touch the electricity, you will be stunned and won't be able to move for a while. Don't move forward until you take out the sensor and stop the electricity. [CR]After you take out the weak point, look at the map while proceeding. You'll know whether to go left or right. [CR]You can dodge enemy bullets by lying down! Destroy rolling mines by using crouch shots.[CR]As you proceed, there are weak points that are positioned so that you can't reach them. Utilize jump shots and crouch shots.[CR]* Beware of falling off at Stage 4: In the waterfall, missing a platform and falling down will count as a miss.[CR]* Barrier: The Barrier power-up can only be found at the beginning of Stage 4 (the Waterfall) or halfway through Stage 9 (the Hangar) if the player has only their normal gun equipped[CR]* Rapid Bullets: The Rapid Bullets power-up will only appear in the beginning of the Waterfall stage and halfway through Snow Field stage (before fighting the first tank) if the player has only the normal gun equipped. Because of this, the only weapons the Rapid Bullets upgrade can be used with are the normal gun, the Fire Ball gun, and the Machine Gun.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Crime City (c) 1989 Taito Corporation.[CR]A one or two player sideways scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which two cops, by the name of Tony Gibson and Raymond Brody, fight gangs of criminals over six platform-strewn stages. Each stage centres around a specific criminal activity, such as bank robbery or smuggling. The ultimate goal in Crime City is to find the King-pin 'boss' characters that await the players at the end of each level, and arrest them.[CR]The game's heroes start each level armed with a pistol, and extra weapons become available as players progress through a level. Both the pistol and additional weapons have only a limited amount of ammunition, and if players runs out of ammo, they will only be able to punch or "somersault attack" into attacking enemies. Each stage features numerous background items that can be used to attack enemies, such as wooden barrels, boxes and hanging lights. When shot, some criminals drop packets of illegal drugs, which can be picked up for bonus points.[CR]Crime City's gameplay takes its inspiration from both Namco's "Rolling Thunder" and Sega's "Shinobi".[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Taito B System Hardware[CR]Board Number: K1100470A[CR]Prom Stickers: B99[CR]Main CPU: Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz), Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips: Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR]=&gt; Shoot/Punch, Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Crime City was released in September 1989.[CR]The two heroes of Crime City are inspired from Mel Gibson and Danny Glover of 'Lethal Weapon' series.[CR]Crime City is an official Spin-off of the Chase H.Q series (you can see the black Porsche from "Chase H.Q.").[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Level Select: Boot machine with service switch pressed.[CR]Message appears: Service Switch Error, press 1p Start(x3), service switch, 1p Start.[CR]Message appears: Select by down SW, select level with joystick Down/Up and push Start button.[CR]* Different Level: The level 2 design depends of your stock and health.[CR]</plot>

Players can switch between the two modes at any time, but only carry a limited amount of grenades or rockets. Weapon power-ups and additional grenades and rockets can be picked up throughout the levels.[CR]At the end of certain levels, the game's heroes will enter an elevator and players can then choose whether to go 'up' or 'down', depending on which route through the game they wish to take.

				<plot>Escape From The Planet of the Robot Monsters (c) 1989 Atari Games Corp.[CR]Escape From The Planet Of The Robot Monsters is a one or two-player game in which the players must rescue Dr. Sarah Bellum from Planet X, where her research facility has been taken over by the evil Reptilons. The game is played from an isometric perspective where players control their avatars using Hall effect joysticks. The Hall effect is the production of a voltage difference (the Hall voltage) across an electrical conductor, transverse to an electric current in the conductor and a magnetic field perpendicular to the current. It was discovered by Edwin Hall in 1879.[CR]The player must shoot their way through a series of simple maze-like levels, releasing the human hostages along the way. Levers must be found and thrown to activate the escalators which allow access to new areas. Gems can be collected to increase the power of the player's ray gun, and food lockers may be broken into for a health boost.[CR]At the end of each level the play switches to an isometric auto-scrolling sequence in which the player controls his character in a small spaceship, and must steer left or right to navigate through a maze of obstacles.

				<plot>Green Beret (c) 1985 Konami.[CR]Green Beret is a sideways-scrolling action/platform game set during the Cold War, in which a US Special Forces Marine must infiltrate a Russian military base to save four POW's from being executed by firing squad. [CR]Initially, the soldier is armed with only a combat knife, but by killing the certain enemy troops, players can obtain either a three-shot flamethrower, a four-shot RPG, or a three-pack of hand grenades. [CR]The Marine can jump or lie down to avoid the enemy bullets, as well as climbing ladders to avoid enemies and projectiles, as well as the flashing land mines that litter the levels. While it's possible to remain still in one area to rack up points, if players take too long to proceed, the game will start sending out tougher enemies and eventually a stealth-like bomber will appear to take out the player. There is also an unseen time limit that will kill off players if they take too long to complete the stage. [CR]The game has four stages in total: a missile base, a harbour, an air Base and a Siberian POW Camp. At the end of each stage the Marine will face a group of enemies specific to that stage: Stage 1 ends with a truckload of running and jump-kicking soldiers, Stage 2 with a pack of fierce dogs and their handlers, Stage 3 with three Gyro-copters and Stage 4 with a number of multi-shot flamethrower operators. [CR]The game is completed once the captives have been rescued at the end of the fourth stage, after which the action starts over with an increased level of difficulty.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX577[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : SN76496 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Green Beret was released in October 1985.[CR]This game is known in US as "Rush'n Attack".[CR]Also manufactured by Irem as the same name.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Go wild using weapons! : The weapon-providing character appears frequently.

				<plot>Gun.Smoke (c) 1985 Capcom  Company, Limited.[CR]Gun.Smoke is a vertically-scrolling shoot-em-up set in the Wild West, in which the player takes the role of a Billy; a young Sheriff charged with hunting down and killing a number of infamous 'Wanted' outlaws.[CR]Each level is packed with gun-toting bandits and the Sheriff must shoot his way through the stage, before finally taking on the wanted outlaw 'boss' character at the end. Each outlaw wields a special weapon unique to them, such as a Winchester rifle, knives, darts or boomerangs.[CR]Shooting the barrels that litter the levels reveals power-ups such as boots (for extra speed), rifles (for increased range) and bullets (for rapid fire). The game's 3 directional fire buttons (for firing left, right or ahead) can be combined (pressed Simultaneously) to create a total of 8 different firing directions.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) Yamaha YM2203 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Gun.Smoke was released in November 1985. [CR]Gun.Smoke is based on the old famous T.V. series of the same name, the first TV broadcast was on September 10, 1955, and it ran until March 31, 1975. A total of 633 episodes were aired over the 20 seasons - only the last nine seasons being made in colour. [CR]Jaime Guzman holds the official record for this game with 1465250 points.

Once he is dead, walk over his corpse and your horse will be killed. Roy raises from the dead as a sort of indestructible zombie. You can shoot him as much as you like, but he won't die. In this way you can play until you get tired of it. [CR]* Secrect Character : If the total of inserted credit (NOT current credit) is a multiple of 16 (16, 32, 48...), the secret character 'Aka-jirou' (Red-dragonfly) appears and you can get 10000 pts when you kill it. [CR]The number of dragonflies at one time is changed by current total inserted credit, for example : 64 credits = 4 dragonflies, 128 credits = 8 dragonfiles.

				<plot>Guerrilla War (c) 1987 SNK.[CR]The country is struggling under the cruel domination of its evil King. The rebel guerilla leader and his comrades attempt to secretly land on shore. The King's military is waiting for them, however, and the players must fight their way inland to reach and destroy the King's palace stronghold.[CR]In this, the pseudo-sequel to SNK's own superb "Ikari Warriors" (released two years earlier), players must once again shoot their way through a number of vertically scrolling levels, all packed with large numbers of enemy soldiers, gun emplacements and vehicles. Each level also contains a number of captured prisoners tied to wooden stakes, and these can be rescued for extra points. [CR]The players' weapons have only a limited amount of ammunition and additional ammo/grenades must be picked up along the way. A number of gun upgrades can also be found. At various points in the game, players can also enter unoccupied enemy tanks, which provide increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to exit the tank before the explosion occurs. Should the player be caught inside or near the tank when it explodes, a life is lost.[CR]As with "Ikari Warriors", Guerrilla War features full 360 degree gameplay with attacking troops appearing from all directions. The players' on-screen counterparts are able to rotate themselves accordingly.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : A7003 'GV'[CR]Main CPU : (2x) Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM3526 (@ 4 Mhz), Y8950 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Vertical[CR]Video resolution : 224 x 384 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 1024[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : dial[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in March 1988 (even if the titlescreen says 1987).[CR]This game is based on the Cuban revolutionary war against the Bautistas that occurred in the 1950's. The first player controls Ch&#232; Guevara and the second player controls Fidel Castro, current Cuban dictator. The storyline was changed completely for the US version, because Fidel Castro of Cuba and the United States are bitter enemies, and out of respect for the Cuban Missile Crisis.[CR]The Japanese version of this game is called "Guevara".[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Nintendo Famicom (1989)[CR]* Computers :[CR]Amstrad CPC (1988)[CR]Sinclair ZX Spectrum (1989)[CR]Commodore 64 (1989)[CR]Commodore Amiga (1989)[CR]Atari ST (1989)[CR]IBM PC[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Run N Gun - Ikari Warriors</title_clean>
				<plot>Ikari Warriors (c) 1986 SNK.[CR]SNK's answer to Capcom's 'Commando', released a year earlier, one or two players take on the role of a "Rambo-esque" soldier as they fight on land and water to reach the village of Ikari. most of the action takes place on foot, although players will occasionally stumble across unoccupied enemy tanks which can be entered and driven. Standing between the players and their destination are a multitude of enemy soldiers, tanks, helicopters and static gun emplacements.[CR]Each different enemy soldier-type is equipped with a different weapon, such as a semi-automatic machine gun, automatic machine gun, grenades, and super grenades. To assist the players in their struggle, a number of power-ups can be picked up, such as extended shot range and hand-grenades. As the players' munitions are deletable, additional ammo/grenades must to be picked up along the way. players can also enter tanks, which offer increased firepower as well as resistance to enemy shots. Too many enemy hits, however, will eventually see the tank explode - this is proceeded by a warning flash to allow the player to leave the tank before the explosion takes place. Should the player be caught inside when the tank explodes, a life is lost.[CR]Unlike Capcom's 'Commando', Ikari Warriors features 360 degree gameplay, as a result of this the home conversions could never hope to match the arcade machine's rotary joystick controls.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : A5004 'IW'[CR]Main CPU : (2x) Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) YM3526 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Vertical[CR]Video resolution : 216 x 288 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 1024[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : dial[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in March 1986.[CR]This game is known in Japan as "Ikari".[CR]The two heroes of the Ikari Warriors series, Paul and Vince, appear in the King of Fighters series as Ralf Jones and Clark Steel.[CR]Stan Szczepanski holds the official record for this game with 1,799,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When driving a tank, try to avoid upgrading from cannonballs to missiles. Cannonballs explode as supergrenades, making it easier to hit gates and squadrons of men. Missiles, unfortunately, only take out one obstacle and will explode upon reaching their maximum range, which is rarely where you'd like the explosions to be.[CR]* There are times when incoming missile triggers are impossible to avoid in the tank. A bug in the machine maximizes the number of explosions that can be onscreen at one time. When you MUST run over a trigger, fire off three shots rapidly timed to explode when the missile lands. With luck, the computer will be unable to generate the explosion and you and your tank can continue.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Ikari Warriors (1986)[CR]2. Victory Road (1986)[CR]3.

				<title_clean>Run N Gun - Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001</title_clean>
				<plot>Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (c) 1996 Nazca.[CR]A scrolling 'run-and-gun' platform game for one or two players, Metal Slug is a humorous parody of war and specifically of World War II and the Nazis.[CR]The game features six enemy-packed levels, referred to as 'missions'. Players start the game armed only with a pistol, but extra weapons can be picked up and used for greater firepower. Also, at certain points during a level players will find an unused 'Super Vehicle-001' - or Metal Slug - tank which can be entered and driven. The Metal Slug is slow-moving but has very powerful weapons. If the Slug takes too many hits it will break down and start to flash, the player must then quickly exit the vehicle before it explodes. The enemy troops also have vehicles at their disposal, such as tanks, boats and helicopters.[CR]The levels are littered with bearded hostages who, when rescued, award players with either points bonuses (in the form of medals) or weapon power-ups. Available weapons are Heavy Machine Gun, Flame Shot, Rocket Launcher and Shotgun. Hand grenades are also available.[CR]Each level ends with at least one large enemy 'Boss' vehicle that takes many hits to destroy. Once the boss has been destroyed, bonus points are awarded for each prisoner rescued. Further bonus points are awarded if the player's Metal Slug vehicle has survived the boss battle.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0201[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 320 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 59.19 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 4096[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; Character &gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Jump, [C] Grenade[CR]=&gt; Metal Slug&gt; [A] Gun Attack, [B] Jump Board Vehicle, [C] Artillery Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Metal Slug was released in April 1996. [CR]Etymology of 'Metal Slug': Meeher, the lead designer of the game for Nazca, wanted to create an armored fighting vehicle that could crawl on the ground like a 'slug'. The word 'metal' in the title indicates that the vehicle is mechanical. Initially, players considered the title to be "not good enough". Meeher later joked about the title, saying "Maybe I don't make much [sic] of a sense?" [CR]Slugs in Metal Slug sequels included animals (usually only the Vulcan cannon mounted on the animal, with a cannon attachment occasionally available), planes and other vehicles that did not fit Meeher's original definition. [CR]While being an obvious parody of World War II and the Nazi regime (the rebel army's flag is a deliberate pastiche of the Nazi "Swastika"), Metal Slug also lampoons 'Full Metal Jacket' and 'MASH'. General Morden, the rebel army's evil general, is a parody of Saddam Hussein. [CR]Just as the two main heroes (Marco &amp; Tarma) appear in every chapter in the Metal Slug series, General Morden &amp; Allen O' Neill (the machine gun wielding, trash mouth-talking, buffed soldier) are the series' classic main villains.[CR]The tank in Metal Slug was inspired by the tank: Dominio Tank Police (1988). The tank in this anime is called Bonaparte and is piloted by Leona Ozaki.[CR]Cliff Reese holds the official record for this game with 2,683,030 points on March 8, 2011. [CR]The same team that created Metal Slug had previously created a handful of games for Irem, most of which featured very similar graphics and gameplay. "Cyber Lip" (1990) had some of the core developers as the original Metal Slug. "Gunforce" (1991) and "In the Hunt" (1993) had noticeably similar gameplay, with graphics that bear a slight resemblance to Metal Slug. "Gunforce 2" (1994) not only had similar gameplay but the sounds of dying soldiers were almost exactly the same as Metal Slug. Because of this, some fans refer to Gunforce 2 as "Metal Slug Zero".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Metal Slug features a 'blood ON' option (soldiers squirt blood when shot, instead of water). This can be activated via the 'Setting The Soft Dip' option in the game's dip switch menu. [CR]* When you parachute into the level at the start of a mission, press B to make the parachute disappear, allowing your character to drop to the ground more quickly. [CR]* Don't waste ammo. Metal Slug requires some thinking and shooting indiscriminately is not the best way to play this game. [CR]* Don't waste special weapons on shields. Shielded soldiers will throw their shields aside when they need to fire, so shoot at them only at this instant. Or use your knife if you manage to get close enough. [CR]* Use your knife against lone enemies. There is no need to waste ten rounds of your Heavy Machine Gun on a single enemy soldier. [CR]* When Metal Slug is dangerously low on health (but not so low that you are forced to leave it), use the frontal attack to inflict major damage. [CR]* Whenever you jump out of the slug, you are invincible for a brief amount of time. This is especially useful against the blue mortars, since they can't be avoided. Note, however, that there is no period of invincibility when you jump back into the slug. [CR]* There is apparently no 'reload time' when you throw grenades or rockets. The rate depends on how many of either are currently on-screen so if you are close to an enemy, the rate will be negligible. You may use this trick against some bosses and in any other situation to pass through unscratched. [CR]* The best way to earn points in to rescue hostages, but this can be tricky. The first problem is finding them, the second is to stay alive to the end of the mission to get credit for your rescues. [CR]As well as the easily-spotted hostages that litter the levels, there are also numerous hidden hostages: [CR]MISSION 1 (hostages: 10): [CR]Two pairs of are hostages hidden in the two waterfalls just before you get to the boss. Just blast the tops of the waterfalls and they will fall. [CR]MISSION 2 (hostages: 12): [CR]Blast down at the green bush underneath the bridge just before you reach the mid level boss (large tank on rails above you) and three secret prisoners will come running in your direction. [CR]MISSION 3 (hostages: 15): [CR]There are secret hostages hidden within the two large trees that you can blast down in the section where you have the Metal Slug tank. These seem to be random, just try blasting those trees down and sometimes they appear. [CR]There are hidden hostages that drop down from the sky when you are fighting the end of level boss; just don't kill the boss until they have all appeared. [CR]MISSION 4 (hostages: 20): [CR]Just after you have got the Metal Slug tank at the beginning of the level, blast the ceiling of the bar just above the light/lampshade high up on the wall at the entrance of the bar. [CR]At the end of level bosses you can either blast in the top right hand corner of the cave to get three hidden hostages OR blast the far bottom left hand corner for three hidden hostages. It is not possible to get both of these groups. You can only get one or the other. [CR]MISSION 5 (hostages: 13):[CR]Blast the first and second houses and two hostages will appear. [CR]Fire at the top of the first and second trees in the stage in between the shops and houses. The first tree yields three POW's and the second only two.[CR]Blast the undercarriage of the end of level boss after it has lifted up on stilts to get three extra prisoners who also provide useful power ups. [CR]MISSION 6 (hostages: 25): [CR]At the beginning, shoot above you to find one prisoner. [CR]Destroy the big pack of rocks to deliver one POW. [CR]Blast the small white cloud above you just after the boat you are on has run ashore to get two hidden hostages. [CR]When you're out of the boat, go left in the water to find some points. [CR]POWs appear on screen during the fight with the final boss, if you shoot in the top right corner. [CR]* Beat the game in two players mode to view a different ending sequence.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001 (1996)[CR]2.

This time, however, Morden has acquired a number of powerful allies to aid him in his evil schemes, some of which are not even human. The 2 brave soldiers are called upon to deal with this threat once again, aided by members of the newly founded 'Sparrow Squad', Fio and Eri.[CR]Metal Slug 2 improved on much of what made the first game great; featuring more enemies, larger bosses, more weapons, more vehicles, more hostages, more surprises and more humour than its illustrious predecessor.

But you have to stay alive to get credit for your rescues (Once you complete a mission, you receive 10'000 pts for every POW).[CR]MISSION 1, Deserts of Arabia : You are sent to control a loyalist force suspected of building weapons of mass destruction.[CR]* The tallest tree after the 1st building contains lots of fruit and 3 hidden POW's.[CR]* Palace : Shoot towards the right of the red banner to release 2nd lieutenant Hyakutaro Ichimonji. This mystic POW has an energy bolt which is powerful and homes in on anything you can shoot (this means structures as well; collateral damage). He'll help you until you finish the mission or die.[CR]* You'll find the Camel Slug after the conversing Arabs. It comes equipped with a Vulcan but provides no cover against enemy fire. Like the Metal Slug, the Camel can run over enemy soldiers.[CR]* BOSS 1, Harrier VTOL : Waves of swordsmen rush at you. Take them out before they get too close. After about 100 shots, 2 bazooka grunts open fire. Stay in between the jet exhausts. Aim for the engines as much as possible (You'll see and get 10,000 pt. for the 1st wing and 50,000 for the 2nd).[CR]MISSION 2, Valley of the Pharaohs : Intelligence has indicated that the enemy army is using a secret Egyptian site to house military machinery.[CR]* Use your gun to knock out an eye from the Sphinx (30,000 pts).[CR]* Without hitting the explosive barrel, kill the Imperial Guards. Then, fire at the top right corner offscreen, for 3 POW's.[CR]* If you stand next to the 1st and 3rd miners, they'll dig up some bonus items.[CR]* Shoot at the top right of the support tower for a POW.[CR]* Pyramid slope : A gem or 3 POW's are hidden at the top of the screen, right above the spot where the 1st mummy pops up.[CR]* If you get a whiff of undead breath, you'll become a member of the undead, identifiable only by headgear. You'll be carrying only a pistol. Jumping is also quite a task. The flashing healing potions will turn you back into a human instantly.[CR]* Near the door, get the POW's before clearing out the mummies.[CR]* You'll catch up with Rumi Aikawa here. Shoot her for a healing potion or points.[CR]* The eye hieroglyph before the special mummy hides a gem.[CR]* Shoot the deceased explorer to make her give up a gem. Disgruntled, she'll give you the matching stick of dynamite.[CR]* Jogging to the left, you'll see a few platforms to jump on. From the 2nd to the top, you can carefully jump over to the right. The long one holds 2 treasure chests. But don't stop here. Carefully jump on top of the cat statues. Shoot the chest open, which holds a magic lamp. If you are patient enough, a djinni will appear. Wait just a moment longer, and he'll grant a wish for riches. Starting from the moment the lamp is released, count the plumes of smoke and jump after the 5th one. Shoot above the right statue for another magic lamp.[CR]* On the next level path (8th platform), the head of the hieroglyph holds gems. Shoot'em out!![CR]* If you let the mummy attack the explorer, you can destroy the new mummy for a gem.[CR]* The twin-armed Slugnoid vehicle is located on one of the higher ledges of the tower of doom. The main cannon (C) fires downwards ((A)+(B) Swan Dive)[CR]* BOSS 2, Iron Claw : Use your cannon and bombs. If you stay at the same altitude for a while, Iron Claw rears back and charges towards you. It won't fire while doing so, giving you time to get free hits in. When Iron Claw primes up, jump to the side ledges.[CR]* BOSS 2 Freeze bug - Stop the nasty climbing! This original flaw give players an unfair advantage to eliminate Boss2 without any difficulty. Below is the following of how to activate. When the player standing on the platform which placed on the last chest, jump to the right edge of the next platform and fall to right lower platform immediately. The screen scrolls up and the boss emerges from the bottom of the screen. Instead of being killed as usual, the player is still there safe and sound ,while the boss freezes and do no climbing at all. At this moment, Just stay on the platform where you are and attack then it will be destroyed afterwards. The trick is also possible when riding the slugnoid or two players' game, but both player must do it at the same time.[CR]MISSION 3, Supply Train : You've managed to catch up with an enemy train headed for a night shipment to the Far East.[CR]* At the engine of the train, rescue the POW. Shoot at the smokestack from below to release 3 POW's.[CR]* From the head of the engine, manage to clear more space with your jump to the next train for 50,000 pt.[CR]* Use the Slug flyer which is equipped with a Vulcan that is limited in angular range.[CR]* BOSS 3, Four Legger : While the boss is standing, jump to shoot at it. Everything except the flame-thrower can be avoided by hiding underneath its legs. If you still have the Slug flyer, stay on the left.[CR]MISSION 4, Chinese City, Downtown : A platoon of enemy troops is stationed nearby. [CR]* Collect as much of the food as you can. Once you're fat, your weapons will cause more damage but you'll be slower.[CR]* Most of the buildings can be demolished, revealing hidden POW's or bonuses. Some of the POW's can be reached by knocking down the building they're on or the one next to it.[CR]* Right about where the monkey and fish are, jump into an opening in the walkway and find POW's and a diet shake.[CR]* Sitting on a rooftop of the residential area is your Metal Slug.[CR]* BOSS 4, Big Tank (kind of battleship) : Only the cannons take damage during this battle. If using the Metal Slug, try for the lower cannons first. Use the houses and boulders to aim for the higher guns.[CR]MISSION 5, New York : The townsfolk have been complaining about strange smells and sounds coming from the sewers. Intelligence confirms that a battalion is stationed inside, ready for an invasion. [CR]* Jump on top of any of the cars, firing downwards. The car will burst in flames, sending you into the sky to reach a lot of bonus items.[CR]* At the end of the street, shoot at the fire escape of the last building for 3 POW's and into the tree for fruits.[CR]* At the underground railroad, shoot into the top of the arch for POW's.[CR]* As soon as one of the 4 trains approaches from the right, fire immediately.[CR]After destroying each one, run to the right to regain any lost ground.[CR]* After marker zero (0), the track bends from here. But before you shoot at the EXIT door, fire at the ceiling. There are 3 separate spots with hostages.[CR]* In the sewers, you see a box with an arrow on it. Find the lever and press (A) to wind it. After 3 turns, an item will drop down with a weapon or bonus.[CR]* BOSS 5, Nuclear Submarine : Surfacing from the sewer slime, the sub attacks with a lot of lightning balls and a thunder cannon. When you see double barrels pop up, prepare for some serious thunder. Fire the Vulcan and bomb it at the same time. [CR]MISSION 6, Siberian Shipyard : Far from Moscow, the rebel army has secretly established war factories and rebel headquarters.[CR]* Mountainside : the sign with the arrow hides a POW.[CR]* Midboss, Super Soldier : Fully recovered from his wounds of Metal Slug 1, he challenges you to another showdown. The horizontal shots can be ducked. Sometimes, you can knife him once and jump away. Take whatever shots you can in the meanwhile.[CR]* In the submarine factory, after busting the tank, use the platform to release the hostage on the higher platform.[CR]* Small platforms give you access to some of the prisoners on the top level, but it's easier to fight aliens on the lower platform.[CR]* When the 2nd area is clear, turn the crank to release a Laser Rifle.[CR]* 3 POW's are hanging at the top of the screen after the 3rd area.[CR]* A POW is hidden on the short plank in the 4th area.[CR]* BOSS 6, Battle Drone : Use the platform to the left whenever possible. When the rod is exposed, it will prime up for 2 seconds, then fire a bolt. Keep a constant fire when free from the Battle Pods. [CR]* FINAL BOSS, Mothership : Fear not the various grunts and tanks, they are here to help you. Try using them for cover. Aiming upward from anywhere will hit some section of the ship. The soldiers bring in a Metal Slug later in the battle, just unload it from the truck. After a long and ruthless battle, the Mothership withdraws.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Metal Slug 3 (c) 2000 SNK.[CR]The heroes of the first 2 games return once more to do battle with the ever-present General Morden and his vast army. The third game of the series places a greater emphasis on defeating hulking boss characters than the 2 previous outings. Metal Slug 3 also introduced multiple routes through most levels, vastly increasing the replay value of the game. For example; on the first level the player reaches a point where they can either continue over land, or enter a small submarine and head down into the ocean depths, where they will be faced with a variety of huge, deadly sea-dwelling creatures.[CR]Metal Slug 3 introduced a number of new elements that have a direct effect on the player's character - similar to the 'mummification' of the second game. The first of these is the 'fatty' affect : should the player pick up too much food (fish, for example) their character will morph in an obese version of itself. This doesn't have any detrimental effect on performance and is included purely for reasons of humour. Another effect is the now infamous 'Zombiefication'; should the player's character be attacked by a Zombie, he or she will become Zombie until they are either killed, or pick up a first-aid, which will restore the player's character back to human form. Movement while in the zombie state is slow and restricted but the player is armed with what can perhaps be best described as the 'Zombie Vomit'; a huge arc of blood that can be used to destroy oncoming enemies. A second Zombie attack while the player's character is in a Zombie state will result in the player losing a life.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-256[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; Character &gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Jump, [C] Grenade[CR]=&gt; Metal Slug&gt; [A] Gun Attack, [B] Jump Board Vehicle, [C] Artillery Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Metal Slug 3 was released in May 2000. This game was the last game in the Metal Slug series developed by SNK. The underwater stages are a graphical nod to Irem's 1993 classic, "In the Hunt". This is understandable as many of SNK's Metal Slug developers originally worked for Irem.[CR]Metal Slug 3 features a number of sci-fi movie homages : Mission 2 features a guest appearance by the Men in Black. The carnivorous plant aliens in Mission 4 are a parody of the sci-fi musical comedy, 'The Little Shop of Horrors'. The squid-like aliens in the gigantic Mission 5 (known as 'Mars People') are a homage to the movie, 'Independence Day'. Also, the alien clones you face in this stage seem to parody the sci-fi movie clasic, 'Invasion of the body snatchers'. Finally, the last boss battle seems to be slightly inspired by the ending sequence in the sci-fi horror movie, 'Alien Resurrection'. One of the hostages (who also appeared in "Metal Slug 2" &amp; "Metal Slug X", by the way) known as Hyakkutaro will join the fight by shooting fireballs.[CR]Noise Factory released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Metal Slug 3 Original Soundtrack - NF-0002) on 31/01/2003.[CR]A hack of this game was released in 2005 as "Metal Slug 6 [Hack]", one year before the official "Metal Slug 6".[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Metal Slug 5 (c) 2003 SNK Playmore.[CR]A research installation developing the next-generation of Metal Slugs is attacked by unknown forces and a disk containing Metal Slug secrets is stolen. Ordered to recover the disk, Marco and Tarma follow in hot pursuit. Meanwhile, Eri and Fio, investigating the Ptolemaic Army, a paramilitary syndicate active in archeological excavation, catch up with them at an ancient ruin, 'The Corridor of Fire'. The two try to storm and seize the site but are repulsed by the natives and giant Metal Slugs. This incident proves it was the Ptolemaic Army that stole the Metal Slug secrets. The military subsequently launches a second raid by the elite PF squad and Sparrows on the 'The Corridor of Fire' to recover the secrets and destroy the syndicate!!![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-268[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 4[CR]=&gt; Character &gt; [A] Shoot, [B] Jump, [C] Grenade[CR]=&gt; Metal Slug &gt; [A] Gun Attack, [B] Jump Board Vehicle, [C] Artillery Attack, [D] Metal Slug Attack[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Metal Slug 5 was released in November 2003.[CR]This new episode introduces a new 'slide' move to the legendary series (actioned holding down the B button).

				<plot>Mystic Warriors - Ikari no Ninja (c) 1993 Konami.[CR]Mystic Warriors is a horizontally-scrolling platform beat-em-up for up to four players, in which the evil 'SKULL' organisation has taken over the world and driven its terrified civilians into hiding. Five Ninja warriors set about destroying SKULL and freeing the World from its grip.[CR]Mystic Warriors features five selectable characters, one of which is shown being kidnapped by SKULL once players have made their character choices. What follows is eight levels of platform 'run-and-gun' action, with an end-of-level boss waiting at the end of each stage.[CR]Players are armed with both Shuriken throwing stars and with a sword for close encounters. Numerous boxes are scattered throughout the levels (or are being carried by enemies), all of which contain bonus items such as weapon power-ups or energy-replenishing food. Other power-ups include an invulnerability shield (known as the "Shinobi Shield") which lasts a few seconds and a "Smart Bomb" power-up, which destroys all on-screen enemies. Some boxes also contain points-giving items, such as bags of money, jewellery and gold.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX128[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) K054539 (@ 48 Khz)[CR]Players: 2 or 4 (selectable by Dipswitch)[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; Shuriken/Sword, Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Mystic Warriors was released in February 1993.[CR]The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Wrath of Ninja'.[CR]The attract mode intro from "Sunset Riders" plays on the large theatre screen at the end of Stage 1.[CR]King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Amusement Sounds '93 - Summer) on 08/1993.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version is slightly different, it has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Designer: Hideyuki Tsujimoto[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Run N Gun - Narc</title_clean>
				<plot>NARC (c) 1988 Williams Electronics Games, Incorporated.[CR]NARC is a graphically violent one or two-player side-scrolling shoot-em-up in which players take on the role of "Narcs"; futuristic police officers whose duty it is to either arrest or kill drug dealers, junkies and attack dogs as players fight to crush the criminal empire known as K.R.A.K. [CR]The Narcs have both machine guns and rocket launchers at their disposal and players can also pick up (confiscate) discarded drugs and money to earn extra points. These are totaled up at the end of each level. On many stages a special colour-specific 'Keycard' needs to be found before players can progress to the next section of the level. [CR]Narc's stages are as follows: [CR]* The Junkyard [CR]* K.R.A.K. Street [CR]* The Bridge [CR]* Sunset Strip [CR]* Skyhigh's Nursery [CR]* Downtown [CR]* Red Level 1 [CR]* Blue Level 2 [CR]* Mr. Big's Office [CR]* Inner Sanctum [CR]* Jackpot![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Williams Z Unit hardware[CR]Main CPU : TMS34010 (@ 6 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : (2x) M6809 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.57958 Mhz), (2x) DAC, HC55516 (@ 3.57958 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]NARC was released in December 1988 and was the first arcade game to use a 32-bit processor (TMS34010).[CR]Max Force (Player One) was a part of Acclaim's (who made the NES version of NARC) 'Power Team' along with Tyrone ("Arch Rivals"), Kuros (Wizards and Warriors/Ironsword), Bigfoot (the monster truck) and Kwirk the tomato, in an animated series featuring the characters. Three of the NARC bosses : Mr. Big, Dr. Spike Rush and Joe Rockhead were the villains on the series.[CR]Grunge band the Pixies released a cover of the tune from level 2-1 of this game in 1991 as 'Theme From Narc', as a B-side to the single 'Planet Of Sound'. It can also be found on the later 'Pixies Complete B-Sides' album.[CR]A NARC unit appears in the 1990 movie 'Don't Tell Her It's Me', in the 1990 movie 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' and in the 1991 movie 'Terminator 2 - Judgment Day'.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* While coming out of any door, move the joystick Left. IMMEDIATELY after your character appears, move the joystick Up. If you do everything correctly, your cop will be 'stuck' to the wall, and will be able to walk on the wall to the next stage.[CR]* Specific Advice For The Same Trick : an easy way to get free lives is on the first level. Right after you leave the subway, keep your joystick pointed up. If you do this, you will 'stick' to the wall and nobody can touch you, though you can arrest tons of people (50 is the max). You can do this in other levels, though it does not seem to be as useful. One problem occurs right when you get out of the subway. There is a barrel which obstructs your path in/on the wall. You can just rocket it away if there are people behind the barrel (in respect to you). You can stay on the wall all the way to the passkey spot and into the door.[CR]* To get ridiculous numbers of points and free men, you need to get to the end of the game, or at least where Mr. Big is. Once you've killed him (the little one *and* the big one), and you get to enter the treasure vault, just collect all the big gold blocks, and just wait. Don't do anything, just wait. After a while, the machine will send a pack of those annoying dogs after you. Let them kill you. You'll be sent back a stage in the game. And you have to fight your way back to the next 'bonus' exit door... once you do, mega-points and mega-men.[CR]* Note the automatic teller machines present in a few places.

Unlike the main firepower, which is only straight ahead, the shuri-ken can be fired in all directions by moving the joystick in the opposite direction of which you wish to aim (example : to fire to the left, move the joystick to right and vice versa). This is also the best way to deal with a few of the bosses here : for example, on the stage set in feudal Japan, there are two giant sumo wrestlers who appear as sub-bosses. The main firepower seems to only have minor effect on them, but the shuri-ken are much more effective.[CR]The C button is for firing magical bursts of energy. One drawback is that, similar to "Final Fight" this can cause a little of your life energy to be drained, so it should be used very carefully.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producer: Tsutomu Maruyama[CR]Director: Tsutomu Maruyama[CR]Executive Producer : Kazuo Arai[CR]Director Of Software : Eiji Fukatsu[CR]System programmers : Makio Chiba, Satoshi Okada (SNK)[CR]Programmers : Ryu Hiroyuki, Yuji Noguchi[CR]Character Designers : Tsutomu Maruyama, Shinji Moriyama (as Sinji Moriyama), Takashi Hatono, Hidemi Nagatomo, Hideyuki Kusano[CR]Music Composer : Yuka Watanabe[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]SNK Neo-Geo [JP] (May 29, 1992; "Ninja Commando [Model NGH-050]")[CR]SNK Neo-Geo [US] (May 29, 1992; "Ninja Commando [Model NGH-050]")[CR]SNK Neo-Geo CD [JP] (October 31, 1994; "Ninja Commando [Model ADCD-004]")[CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [JP] (December 18, 2008; "ADK Tamashii [Model SLPS-25906]")[CR]Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console] [JP] (June 24, 2008; "Ninja Commando [Model EAPJ]")[CR]Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console] [US] (July 11, 2008; "Ninja Commando [Model EAPE]")[CR]Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console] [AU] (July 11, 2008; "Ninja Commando)[CR]Nintendo Wii [Virtual Console] [EU] (July 14, 2008; "Ninja Commando [Model EAPP]")[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Run N Gun - Robocop</title_clean>
				<plot>RoboCop - The Future of Law Enforcement (c) 1988 Data East.[CR]A single player, side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up based on the 1987 movie of the same name. The game's story mirrors that of the film, with former cop Murphy, now a half-human cyborg called 'RoboCop', on a quest to bring down the evil OCP corporation.[CR]RoboCop features nine levels of action, with two of the game's nine stages being into-the-screen target ranges, in which players can try to accrue bonus points and earn extra health. Wooden crates occasionally bar RoboCop's progress, but these can be punched to remove them. Marked crates can be smashed to reveal one of three Weapon power-ups; Three-way Gun, Dual Laser and the incredibly powerful Cobra Gun.[CR]The film's incidental music plays throughout the game and RoboCop's speech is sampled directly from the original film.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 10 Mhz), HuC6280 (@ 1.342325 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM2203 (@ 1.5 Mhz), YM3812 (@ 3 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 7.757 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]RoboCop was released in November 1988. [CR]After Ocean Software secured the RoboCop license, they sub-licensed it to Data East who created the coin-up game. Ocean then ported the game to various home computers. [CR]Most of RoboCop's sounds were borrowed from "Heavy Barrel". [CR]A Robocop Cabinet can be seen in the Nickelodeon shows All That (from 1994 to 1997) and Kenan and Kel. However both shows shared the same cabinet, but with different fictional marquees. [CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (G.S.M. Data East 1 - D25B1002) on June 21, 1989.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The bootleg version does not use the HuC6280 @ 1.342325 Mhz :-)[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]The following cheat for RoboCop can earn (theoretically) infinite scores : There exists a level in the game (the Junkyard), where there is an elevator. It's just after you get the Cobra gun. Anyway, you get on the elevator and ride to the top. When the elevator reaches the top, DON'T MOVE! Your score will suddenly start to increase, and will continue to do so until you step off the elevator.[CR]Bad guys come onto the screen when you pass a certain pixel. Move back and kill them off; don't charge through the game. Learn the enemy movement patterns as they are the same in every play.[CR]Here are some strategies for each level: [CR]* LEVEL ONE : The motorbike which damages you before you draw your gun can be beaten by jumping just before it comes on the screen. A shop window has a small menu type poster in it; jump around about there. When you land, punch the bike (it flashes green and doesn't damage you). Punch it when it returns to kill it.[CR]When fighting the ED209, time your jumps until just AFTER it has fired at you, allowing you to jump over its shots. When it moves to the left third of the screen, stand close to it. RoboCop's weapons arm will now point at a steeper angle (more into the ground). Now move away slightly and jump away when ED209 fires. Its shots will go into the ground and not trap you at the left edge of the screen.[CR]Another approach allows you to defeat the ED-209 almost instantaneously: First, make sure you still have the Three-Way Gun (not essential but makes things a little quicker and easier), then as soon as you clear the area of enemies the music will change and the ED-209 will growl. Simply walk to the right side of the screen (Before ED-209 enters) and fire repeatedly diagonally up and right. If done correctly, the ED-209 will come out already defeated and run away without so much as scratching you.[CR]* LEVEL TWO ; To get extra health, shoot the fat guy using a girl as a shield. He moves forward to shoot at you - shoot him then.[CR]Target practice : Getting all of the targets (100% hit) gives *extra* capacity for your energy bar.[CR]Bug : Missing one target sometimes still gives 100% (but don't rely on it.).[CR]* LEVEL THREE : Go over the top of the car crushers, and pick up the baby food. Try and save the Cobra assault cannon for the end of the level - this makes thing much easier. If you shoot just under the cab of the final enemy, you can kill the guy throwing grenades at you.[CR]Alternate way : Get the cobra cannon, clean all the enemies at the elevator, the raise the elevator until the cobra cannon is slightly higher than ground level (about 1/4 inch or less), fire ONCE to the right and watch your score soar. Don't move or your score will stop. Also, this only works on the bootleg board - the original did not do this, probably due to a bug (At the far right, just outside of the screen, are some boxes and the machine thinks you hit them but doesn't destroy them).[CR]* LEVEL FOUR : Shoot the metal crushers with the Cobra Cannon, or PUNCH repeatedly if you get trapped. The final enemy is a crane which swings a steel ball suspended from an extensible chain. Don't shoot the wooden box, stand on it and shoot the cab of the crane. Also, try to save the Cobra Cannon (by punching bad guys instead of shooting them) and use it on the crane.[CR]* LEVEL FIVE : Don't charge through this level, especially on the conveyor belt. Be wary of the first guy armed with a flame thrower; if you're quick enough, you can shoot him before he gets a chance to shoot at you.[CR]The military ED209 at the end of the level can be beaten by crouching under the OCP logo when it charges. Jump and shoot the weapon arm when it retreats.[CR]* LEVEL SIX : You need to move through this level fairly quickly as time is a little tight. The ground-based moving gun turrets can be shot from the platform below, and careful diagonal shooting can destroy laser emplacements situated on any platforms above you. Concentrate on laser turrets which are diagonally away from you, as their fire is the hardest to dodge.[CR]The last baby food on the level replenishes all of RoboCop's energy. Try and keep the laser shots until the end of the level. When you reach the top platform, move as far to the right as possible and shoot the military ED209 as much as possible before it activates. There is a comparatively safe position just at the end of the military ED209's forward walk (like the end of level five, but with no OCP marker). Kill the military ED209 first. Tactics for the other ED209 are similar to those of level 1.[CR]* LEVEL SEVEN : Use diagonal shooting to destroy laser turrets on the platform above you (see also Level Six comment).[CR]The baby food stored in the box gives all your energy back. When you reach the single lift which goes up multiple floors, the best way to avoid being trapped on it by laser fire is to JUMP onto the next level just before the lift reaches it. Timing between the laser shots is critical.[CR]When this lift reaches the top, stop just short of the floor (you should be able to see/hear the light curtains and laser turrets) and then go back down as far as you can. The laser turrets and curtains sometimes disappear.[CR]The final ED209 can be destroyed by standing at the far left of the screen and jumping up and down. Missiles launched at you can be destroyed by shooting or punching. When the ED209 gets too close, use the tactic of level one.[CR]When ED209 is destroyed, kill Dick Jones (in the same way as a gunman holding a hostage is killed). The president is not harmed by your gun shots and must be punched from close range.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. RoboCop - The Future of Law Enforcement (1988) [CR]2. RoboCop 2 (1991) [CR]3.

				<plot>RoboCop 2 (c) 1991 Data East.[CR]An arcade-only sequel to the 1988 original, placing less of an emphasis on platform action than the face game and concentrating almost exclusively on the shooting aspect.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : MAH[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 14 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Hudson Soft HuC6280 (@ 4.0275 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM2203 (@ 4.0275 Mhz), YM2151 (@ 3.58 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 7.627 Khz), OKI6295 (@ 15.255 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3 [LEFT SHOT, RIGHT SHOT, JUMP][CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]RoboCop 2 was released in March 1991.[CR]The movie 'RoboCop 2' is rated R by the Motion Picture Association of America. It is intended for mature audiences and parental guidance is advised. Children under 17 are not admitted unless accompanied by a  parent or adult guardian.[CR]Differences between 'RoboCop 2' the arcade game, and 'RoboCop 2' the movie. Beware : may contain some spoilers for both the movie and the arcade game.[CR]* The gun shop robbers in the movie never had one of them use a chainsaw, whereas the 1st stage boss, he does wield a chainsaw.[CR]* Stage 2's layout's completely inaccurate. in the arcade game, RoboCop (played by Peter Weller) enters the illicit arcade before entering the 'nuke' factory. in the actual movie, RoboCop and his partner Anne Lewis (played by Nancy Allen) first raid the "nuke" factory first, then they head to the illicit arcade to make a raid.[CR]* The stage 2 boss does not exist in the actual movie, and as for RoboCop chasing Cain (played by Tom Noonan), RoboCop does this after going back to the abandoned plant in which RoboCop was ambushed and dismantled by Cain and his gang.[CR]* The motorcycle chase in the movie begins after Cain shakes RoboCop off the van Cain was driving. in the arcade game's second cutscene, RoboCop simply gets on the motorcycle that's against the wall in the end of stage 2.[CR]* Stage 3 is way off the movie's storyline. in the movie, RoboCop goes to the abandoned plant as soon as he finishes interrogating officer Duffy (played by Stephen Lee). also in stage 3, RoboCop is picked up by a magnet. In the movie, this only happens when RoboCop, gets knocked down to the ground during Cain's ambush. the electric zombie punks that appear in the game, don't exist in the movie.[CR]* In the cutscene after stage 3, RoboCop finds a man who got gunned down by RoboCop 2. In the movie RoboCop finds Cain's youngest gang member called Hob (played by Gabriel Damon) gunned down who tells RoboCop about RoboCop 2[CR]* Stage 4 has RoboCop entering Omni Consumer Products H.Q. to find RoboCop 2. In the movie though, after Hob dies, the movie ends up going to the OCP civic centrum.[CR]* The cutscene that happens in before the final stage has RoboCop 2 (who is using Cain's brain) saying that he's ready to face RoboCop. In the movie RoboCop 2, RoboCop 2 never talks. all he can do is growl and squeal).[CR]* Speaking of robots that can growl and squeal, Enforcement Droid 209 (A.K.A. ED-209) appears as a mid-stage boss. however in the movie, RoboCop never confronts ED-209 at all, he only appears in the opening Mediabreak news report.[CR]* In the end RoboCop rips out the brain of Cain off RoboCop 2, but in the arcade game, RoboCop rips the brain from the RoboCop 2 robot (just like Kano's heart rip fatality from the first "Mortal Kombat"). but in the movie, RoboCop gets the brain from the back of RoboCop 2's head. As for the destruction of the brain, RoboCop smashes the brain against the pavement in the movie, in the arcade game however, RoboCop just smashes the brain against the RoboCop 2 robot.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Software Versions : [CR]Version 0.05 USA [CR]Version 0.10 Euro &amp; Asia [CR]Version 0.11 Japan [CR]The US version has the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen. [CR]In the Japanese version, this adventure begins just at the end of the first game, at that moment when RoboCop enters Dick Jone's office floor. This 'playable intro' was deleted in the World and U.S. versions. [CR]This exists in the Japanese version only : If you complete the game without using any continues, there will be an extra scene that features RoboCop 2 (aka RoboCain) for the background photo, and some scribbled writing from the staff (it's sort of like the credits, only with Japanese writing that was done with bright colored chalk).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Rolling Thunder 2 (c) 1990 Namco.[CR]A straight sequel to the superb 1986 original, Rolling Thunder 2 sees one or two players taking control of secret agents in this scrolling, platform shoot-em-up. The agents once again find themselves up against the sinister GERDRA organization and its many armed agents. Gameplay is very similar to the original, with doors both releasing enemies and hiding weapons and ammunition for the players to collect.[CR]Rolling Thunder 2 improves on its illustrious predecessor in a number of ways; the most obvious one being the vastly improved and incredibly colourful graphics. The most striking improvement, however, is the addition of a simultaneous, co-operative two player mode; which adds immeasurably to the game's appeal. For the sequel, the one player agent is a woman, with a second player taking the role of a male agent.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Namco System 2 hardware[CR]Game ID : RTS[CR]Main CPU : (2x) Motorola 68000 (@ 12.288 Mhz), M6809 (@ 3.072 Mhz), HD63705 (@ 2.048 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : C140 (@ 21.39 Khz), YM2151 (@ 3.57958 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (ATTACK, JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Even if the titlescreen says '1990', Rolling Thunder 2 was released in March 1991.[CR]Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Rolling Thunder 2 : Namco Game Sound Express Vol.5 - VICL-15005) on June 21, 1991.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Rolling Thunder (c) 1986 Namco.[CR]Rolling Thunder is a single-player scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which a James Bond-esque secret agent codenamed 'Albatross' has been ordered by the Rolling Thunder anti-espionage unit to stop the criminal organization known as Geldra. Albatross must also rescue captured field agent, Lelia Blitz and overthrow Geldra's leader, Maboo.[CR]Rolling Thunder's gameplay takes place on two levels of platforms, with the player able to jump or drop to platforms as and when required. Albatross begins the game armed with only a standard-issue pistol and a limited amount of ammunition. If the pistol's ammunition runs out, the player can only fire a single slow "chaser" bullet - with only one allowed on-screen at any one time - until more ammo is acquired.[CR]Each level is littered with doors; most of these contain constantly emerging enemies and must be carefully passed; some, however, also provide ammunition and new weapons. Ammo rooms are clearly marked while weapons rooms have re-enforced metal doors. A weapons room gives the player a fully automatic assault rifle that allows for continuous firing by holding down the shoot button. As with the pistol, the assault rifle has a limited amount of ammunition.[CR]The majority of Rolling Thunder's protagonists are hooded soldiers known as "Maskers". Maskers are dressed in various colors, which determines both their strength and attack pattern. Some Maskers do not shoot, but throw grenades instead, while others will shoot their gun while crouching, making their shots much harder to avoid.[CR]Other enemies includes ninjas, mutated bats known as Gelzos, panthers, shrieking yellow creatures known as Blogas and lava men.[CR]Albatross must travel through two different segments or "stories" - each composed of five stages - making for a total of ten stages. The stages in Story 2 are essentially a harder version of their Story 1 counterparts, featuring more traps and different enemy placement. At the end of the final stage, the player must battle the Geldra leader Maboo to rescue Leila and complete the mission.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Namco System 86 hardware[CR]Game ID : RT[CR]Main CPU : (2x) M6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz), Hitachi HD63701 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.57958 Mhz), Namco 8-channel WSG, Namco (@ 6 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Rolling Thunder was released in December 1986.[CR]Rolling Thunder was the first Jamma game ever produced.[CR]Licensed to Atari for US distribution (February 1987). 2,406 units were produced in the USA by Atari.[CR]A Rolling Thunder unit appears in the 1996 movie 'High School High'.[CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Namco Game Music Vol.1 - 28XA-170) on July 25, 1987.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]NEW VERSION :[CR]* New title screen.[CR]* BGM of area 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 10 are changed.[CR]* Different enemy arrangement.[CR]* Addition of a Continue feature.[CR]* Addition of the Extra-life feature.[CR]* 150 time units (180 in the old version).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* One of rolling thunder's more useful 'hidden features' is that it's actually possible to visit the ammo rooms more than once. Once you have stocked up on bullets from a particular room (for example, a Machine-Gun-Bullets room), go forward past the door approximately the distance of two jumps (ensuring that the door in question is completely off screen), then turn back, visit the room again, and find more ammo. The reason this works is because the game is divided into invisible 'sections' and once you cross a section boundary, the game forgets everything from the previous section.[CR]* A step-by-step guide to one of Rolling Thunder's more impressive glitches :[CR]1) In levels five and ten, once you get to a certain point in the level (around halfway through), you come up against two boxes stacked on top of each other (i.e. you can't jump over it), and a platform above you (on which you jump and continue to the RIGHT).[CR]2) At this point, jump UP onto the platform, then position yourself at the very RIGHT EDGE of the railing on the platform (you can only jump up/down where railing is present) which should correspond to the very LEFT EDGE of the BOXES; then jump DOWN. This will put you at the very LEFT EDGE of the boxes.[CR]3) Next, making sure not to move the joystick to the left, walk towards the RIGHT, hit the JUMP button, and you should find yourself 'caught' between the bottom and top boxes. Then jump RIGHT again, clearing the top box and landing on the ground. Don't fire at anyone, and don't panic, but simply go to the RIGHT watch yourself walk through everybody completely unharmed. You can simply walk past everyone until you reach the final, cloak-wearing enemy. Finally, providing you have properly stocked up on 'MG bullets' earlier in the game, simply hold down the fire button and kill the enemy. One final thing to note is that when using this method on level TEN, in that last area before the final arena, there are the 'stairs-like' hurdles, and on each of these steps, a white enemy will appear.[CR]4) You have to be careful not to be in too much of a hurry, or they will follow you into the arena, where they can and will hurt you, or keep you busy enough that the guy in the cloak will. So make sure you have a little extra time to let those guys disappear off the screen (after you've made all of them appear) before going after the guy in the cloak in the arena.[CR]* This is completely useless, but fun to do : at the end of each level there is this force field, which drags you through the door. Just before you get sucked in, turn your back to the exit and make low jumps (jump button only) while pushing the joystick towards the exit. This results in your agent jumping backwards a little every time. When the force field catches you, your character will appear to 'moonwalk' into the exit.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Secret Agent (c) 1989 Data East.[CR]Secret Agent is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up which the player takes on the role of a James Bond-esque secret agent who must fight his way through a terrorist group called 'CWD' to reach the final Boss confrontation and prevent a stolen nuclear missile being launched.[CR]The player starts the game armed only with a pistol, and this has a limited amount of ammunition. Once the ammo has run out, players can only kick their enemies. Machine guns are occasionally dropped by defeated enemies and can be picked up and used. Also, Golden Gun components are sometimes dropped; there are six of these in total and once all have been collected, the player is rewarded with a very powerful golden rifle. This weapon kills all enemies instantly but will only last for twenty-five seconds, indicated by a meter at the top-right of the screen.[CR]Most of the game's eight stages are platform-based, but there are also two underwater scuba levels and a motorbike chase. All of the game's end-of-level bosses reappear on the final 'underground lair' level.[CR]While not officially licensed as a James Bond game, Secret Agent is unmistakably meant to represent both the Bond character and movie series. The Bond villain Jaws shows up at the end of stage two and another famous Bond villain, Odd Job also appears. Another memorable Bond reference is the use of a Shaun Connery impersonator who tells players that they have done a Great job upon completion of a level.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Hudson Soft HuC6280 (@ 3 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM2203 (@ 1.5 Mhz), YM3812 (@ 3 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 7.757 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (ATTACK, JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]This game is known in US as "Sly Spy".[CR]The headless corpse of "Robocop" can be seen lying on the ground at the start of the game's final level.

As well as enemy troops, players must contend with tanks, choppers and assorted military vehicles, and must also be careful to avoid any of the landmines that litter the levels. Extra weapons and health can be picked up from destroyed enemy vehicles, as well as being found in enemy supply crates. Shock Troopers is effectively three games in one as players can chose one of three different routes; each made up of different levels. The game also offers greater variety of gameplay than other of the genre; with levels having the players travel on the back of fast moving vehicles, climbing a rock face etc.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0238[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Shot/Close range attack, [B] Evasive Maneuver, [C] Special attack, [D] Change player (in team battle mode only)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Developed by Saurus.[CR]Released in November 1997.[CR]This game runs on the Neo-Geo MVS but was not released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Shock Troopers Second Squad, Shock Troopers - PCCB-00355) on 01/1999.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Sunset Riders (c) 1991 Konami.[CR]Sunset Riders is a superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up for one to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties given for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West. The ultimate aim is to survive long enough to reach the final showdown against Sir Richard de la Rose. [CR]Sunset Riders is an incredibly playable game featuring colourful and well-drawn graphics, with a number of humorous visual jokes keeping players entertained. The side-scrolling action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with the action sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. [CR]Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. Weapon power-ups can be found and collected to help players in their quest.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX064[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), K053260 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (ATTACK, JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Sunset Riders was released in September 1991. [CR]In the 90s, the official Italian importer for Konami was Elettronica Videogames. Managers of the Japanese company usually visited the foreign partner, bringing a lot of new games and prototypes with them. In one of this circumstances, they brought with them the European prototype of Sunset Riders. In this version, the Mexican character was named 'Hermano' (brother). During a funny moment, trying to say something humorous, the chief technician of the Italian firm proposed: "Why not calling him Cormano?". Cormano, in fact, is the little town near Milan where the importing company was located. [CR]King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.5 - KICA-7605) on September 26, 1992.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US versions have the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]When you're facing off against the first boss, Simon Greedwell, there's a way to fire at him without being hit by his own gunfire. First, all enemies popping out of the house windows need to be cleared away, and the barrel on the left side needs to knocked down, exposing one side of the boss (but make sure you aren't hit and killed by the falling barrel). Then, position your player underneath that side so that he's firing upwards with the left hand at the left side of the boss (this is easier to do if you're holding two guns). If you do this correctly, you'll be able to gun down the boss while his own ammo passes by you harmlessly without touching you.[CR]On the 2nd stage, as you're heading towards the train station where the second boss is waiting, there's an enemy-manned wagon that appears where the occupants throw out at least two logs that you need to jump over, lest you be killed by them. If you can anticipate the appearance of this wagon, you can shoot at the wheel almost instantly upon its arrival to destroy the wagon before they even throw out a single log at you.[CR]On the 4th stage where you face off against the Smith Brothers in the saloon, they throw heavy explosives in your direction, so you need to keep jumping on and off the chandelier and in other directions to avoid their weapons. (Freeing the bar girls will render you intangible for a few seconds.) Don't try to jump onto the platforms where the Smith Brothers are standing while they're still alive, as you can be killed instantly when touching them.[CR]On the 5th stage, the boss, El Greco, carries a whip causing instant death, and a shield. To succeed in hitting him, you need to try and jump around to shoot him from behind, as well as shooting him whenever he jumps, and to do your best to avoid being hit by the whip.[CR]On the final stage, when penetrating Richard Rose's fortress, you need to use the Gatling guns provided to blast your way through two large wooden gates. Just jump onto the stands where your player will automatically grab the gun, point the joystick in the right direction and fire. But be careful, as the Gatling gun's ammo can kill other players as well as the enemy themselves[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Director : Hideyuki Tsujimoto (H. Tsujimoto)[CR]Art director : R.

				<plot>Sunset Riders (c) 1991 Konami.[CR]Sunset Riders is a superb sideways scrolling shoot-em-up for one to four players set in America's Wild West. Four sharpshooter bounty hunters (Steve, Billy, Bob and Cormano) set out to claim the bounties given for killing the most wanted outlaws in the West. The ultimate aim is to survive long enough to reach the final showdown against Sir Richard de la Rose. [CR]Sunset Riders is an incredibly playable game featuring colourful and well-drawn graphics, with a number of humorous visual jokes keeping players entertained. The side-scrolling action takes place both on foot and on horseback, with the action sometimes broken up with a wild west pursuit; such as having to run along the backs of a herd of fleeing Buffalo. [CR]Each level ends with players entering a one-on-one battle against one of the wanted men they have been pursuing. Weapon power-ups can be found and collected to help players in their quest.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX064[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), K053260 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (ATTACK, JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Sunset Riders was released in September 1991. [CR]In the 90s, the official Italian importer for Konami was Elettronica Videogames. Managers of the Japanese company usually visited the foreign partner, bringing a lot of new games and prototypes with them. In one of this circumstances, they brought with them the European prototype of Sunset Riders. In this version, the Mexican character was named 'Hermano' (brother). During a funny moment, trying to say something humorous, the chief technician of the Italian firm proposed: "Why not calling him Cormano?". Cormano, in fact, is the little town near Milan where the importing company was located. [CR]King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Game Music Collection Vol.5 - KICA-7605) on September 26, 1992.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US versions have the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]When you're facing off against the first boss, Simon Greedwell, there's a way to fire at him without being hit by his own gunfire. First, all enemies popping out of the house windows need to be cleared away, and the barrel on the left side needs to knocked down, exposing one side of the boss (but make sure you aren't hit and killed by the falling barrel). Then, position your player underneath that side so that he's firing upwards with the left hand at the left side of the boss (this is easier to do if you're holding two guns). If you do this correctly, you'll be able to gun down the boss while his own ammo passes by you harmlessly without touching you.[CR]On the 2nd stage, as you're heading towards the train station where the second boss is waiting, there's an enemy-manned wagon that appears where the occupants throw out at least two logs that you need to jump over, lest you be killed by them. If you can anticipate the appearance of this wagon, you can shoot at the wheel almost instantly upon its arrival to destroy the wagon before they even throw out a single log at you.[CR]On the 4th stage where you face off against the Smith Brothers in the saloon, they throw heavy explosives in your direction, so you need to keep jumping on and off the chandelier and in other directions to avoid their weapons. (Freeing the bar girls will render you intangible for a few seconds.) Don't try to jump onto the platforms where the Smith Brothers are standing while they're still alive, as you can be killed instantly when touching them.[CR]On the 5th stage, the boss, El Greco, carries a whip causing instant death, and a shield. To succeed in hitting him, you need to try and jump around to shoot him from behind, as well as shooting him whenever he jumps, and to do your best to avoid being hit by the whip.[CR]On the final stage, when penetrating Richard Rose's fortress, you need to use the Gatling guns provided to blast your way through two large wooden gates. Just jump onto the stands where your player will automatically grab the gun, point the joystick in the right direction and fire. But be careful, as the Gatling gun's ammo can kill other players as well as the enemy themselves[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Director : Hideyuki Tsujimoto (H. Tsujimoto)[CR]Art director : R.

				<title_clean>Run N Gun - Xybots</title_clean>
				<plot>Xybots (c) 1987 Atari Games Corp.[CR]Xybots is a 3-Dimensional, 3rd-person perspective shoot-em-up for 1 or 2 players. Taking on the role of either 'Major Rock Hardy' or 'Captain Ace Gunn' (in the 2-player game), players must shoot their way through a huge, multi-level underground city - made up of a series of mazes - and destroy the evil 'Xybot' robot warriors that have invaded the planet and established their underground fortress. The players' on-screen counterparts walk 'into' the screen and players must manually rotate the maze's viewpoint left and right when changing direction in order to be able to look in the direction they are moving. [CR]Each level has at least one exit that must be reached in order to progress to the next (some levels have extra hidden exits that 'warp' players to later levels). Players can find energy pods to restore energy levels, keys to open doors, and golden coins. Some of the levels also feature transporters that connect different parts of the same level.[CR]At the end of each level, players can enter a shop where supplies and power-ups can be purchased with any coins they have collected. Some supplies, such as 'Shield' or 'Speed' are permanent, whereas others are only temporary and must be replenished.[CR]A map of each level is displayed at the top of the screen. For some levels, all enemies, objects and walls are shown. On later levels, however, the map may only display the enemy robots and/or objects; with the maze walls and layout only becoming visible once a player has 'looked' at a wall section. Xybots' gameplay feels highly reminiscent of a 3-Dimensional "Gauntlet" (with good reason, see TRIVIA for more details). The game also uses a split-screen display to allow for two-player simultaneous play; something of an innovation for 1987.[CR]Like the "Gauntlet" games on which Xybots is based; the game is endless and play will continue until all lives are lost and players no longer wish to use the 'Continue' option.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 136054[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 7.15909 Mhz), MOS Technology 6502 (@ 1.7895 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick (that also twists a quarter-turn left or right)[CR]Buttons : 2 (FIRE, ZAP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Xybots was released in November 1987. [CR]1,752 units were produced in the USA. The selling price was $2,295. [CR]Xybots was another in a long line of videogame innovations from Atari. The company had, of course, created the first commercially successful videogame with the legendary "Pong". They went on to develop vector graphics with 1979's "Lunar Lander"; while 1980's "Battlezone" was on the cutting edge of technology with its hitherto unknown three-dimensional vector rendering. [CR]Xybots was the first arcade game to put the player into a three-dimensional, third-person perspective world (with the action viewed from over the on-screen characters' shoulders). Xybots can rightly be considered to be the father of the modern day first person three-dimensional shoot-em-ups. [CR]By 1987, Atari had split into two different companies; with each sharing the Atari name. The first company produced products for the home entertainment arena; such as personal computers, game consoles, and handhelds. The arcade company, owned by Midway, produced arcade machines exclusively. Perhaps because Xybots was so ahead of its time, it wasn't the commercial success that Atari and Midway were hoping for. Its legacy and influence on future shoot-em-ups, however, is without question. [CR]Xybots was originally going to be "Gauntlet III", before Atari changed its mind and created a new Sci-fi setting.  It's development name was "Robox" until the game was completed.[CR]The monsters and shots were rendered with 'motion objects', a method which had been around since 1977. [CR]Joel Hedge holds the official official record for this game, on tournament setting, with 185,300 points on June 2, 2001.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]You start you game with your man (or men in the two-player game) standing at the end of a corridor. Your goal is to make it to the exit while inflicting the most amount of damage without taking too much damage. There is also a quick tutorial during this first level to help you better gain experience for the coming levels.[CR]General Strategies :[CR]* Always look at the level map when you enter a level. There will be a couple of second delay before you enter the level. Look for where the exit is. This also helps to determine whether you are being put in the middle of a group of Xybots.[CR]* Your character can lose energy in a variety of ways :[CR]1) Naturally within the maze itself. You lose 2-3% of your energy in the maze per second. If you purchase the Extra Vitality, your energy will be lost at a slower rate. This rate is usually about 1% per second.[CR]2) Saucers that go Kamikaze will take out 25% of your energy when they hit.[CR]3) All other Xybots take out 10% energy per hit, but they usually fire multiple times.[CR]4) Using the Zapper.[CR]* Saucers like to pick up items and carry them to other parts of the level. This can be especially frustrating if you know where an item is, then return to find it gone because a saucer picked it up. Keep this in mind unless you have taken out all the saucers.[CR]* Money is a very precious commodity in this game. This is what you use to buy the permanent and temporary items in the Supply Store. After level 7, you will be buying everything you need to get through the level. At the bare minimum, you should constantly purchase the following :[CR]1) Wall Mapper x 3 - To give you an idea of how the maze is set up and also where the closest exit is.[CR]2) Monster Mapper x 3 - To give you a general idea of what non-Guardian Xybots are running around.[CR]3) Vitality x 4 - To minimize the amount of energy you lose on the level.[CR]4) These purchases will last you a minimum of three levels before you have to purchase more temporary items.[CR]* Keys are another valuable commodity within the mazes. Keys can open doors that can shorten one's trip to the exit, or they can open doors that have a lot of extra items in them.[CR]* In addition to the above, attempt to get permanent items when you can. The best ones would be extra armor and shot power.[CR]* Use the Warp Exits when you can. With the 75,000 points, you get 3 coins added to the bonus coins for using the warp. In addition, your energy is brought back to 100% again so you don't have to waste money healing up. The warp exits are located on levels 1 and 4.[CR]* Energy orbs can give either a 50% or 100% boost to your energy. If you are only down a little, do not use it. Wait until you are under 50% energy before getting one.[CR]* If you are placed in a wide open area, immediately look for the exit or find a protected corner. This prevents the Xybots from surrounding your character.[CR]* Xybots follow a specific pattern when they move around. Once they spot your character, though, they will immediately go in for the attack. Sometimes multiple Xybots will swarm the area to try to eliminate your character quickly.[CR]* When approaching corridors that turn, doorways, or openings in the wall, turn your character toward that area and sidestep to the turn or opening. That way, if there are any Xybots lurking around, you can get the first shot in and take them out before they know what happened to them.[CR]* Your character's range of vision is four squares around. It is the same for the Xybots. When going down corridors, it's a good idea to put a few shots ''down-range''. The reason is you may catch one of the Xybots ''napping'' and eliminate them before they can react.[CR]* When approaching openings or doorways, stop short of said opening. If a Xybot is patrolling, they won't see your character but you will see their movement pattern and then you can plan accordingly.[CR]* Many of the levels have blue barrels. These can be used for cover when you are busy having shootouts with the Xybots. Just ''peek'' around them to get your shots off.[CR]* Speaking of blue barrels, you can use the Zapper on them to collect items. These items are random.[CR]* Don't use the Zapper unless it is absolutely necessary. Its purpose is to stun the enemies for a couple of seconds. This makes them vulnerable to your attacks. The energy loss to do this, though, is an uneven exchange. You will do better just shooting it out with the Xybots. Of course, if you are surrounded, then that would be a good time to use it.[CR]* When fighting the Flys, keep in mind that they move up-and-down in addition to side-to-side making them very hard targets to hit. It addition, you will need to keep moving around to avoid their fire and the blue barrels provide minimal protection since they can fire above them.[CR]* The teleporters in the maze act in a duel fashion. When you step on one teleporter pad, you will arrive at another one. Get off and step back on the teleporter pad you just arrived on to teleport to another place. Levels with multiple teleporter pads can be very confusing unless you do this.[CR]* Make sure you pick your battles. If you are on a level loaded with Xybots, it may be better to find the exit then to shoot it out with them. Granted, you can get the points, items in the maze, and possible coin bonuses for score. This, though, may be an unfair exchange since you will be taking a large energy drain with little return.[CR]* Watch your energy meter. It will go yellow when you are at 50% and go red when you are at 20% or less.[CR]* Make sure you note the Xybots colors when you are fighting them. This is the key to tell you how many hits it will take to take them down. Don't be surprised if you hit a Xybot once and it is still firing on you.[CR]* Some levels have false walls. These walls can be taken out with your laser fire. They do not show up differently on the main level map. Before you go shooting at the walls, make sure of what is behind those walls. Opening one of these walls could be like kicking a hornet's nest. You find yourself surrounded by Xybots intent on erasing you from existence.[CR]* Some of the levels have a ''wrap-around'' feature. This basically means if you exit the maze on the right side, you will reappear on the left side. It gives the illusion of one continuous maze. On these types of mazes, when you look at the map, make sure you note enemies not only on your side, but on the opposite side as well.[CR]* The big thing is to learn how to turn and move at the same time. This is in addition to being able to fire while performing this maneuver. If you can accomplish this smoothly, your chances of survival are greatly increased.[CR]* On the first level, don't collect any money for totally massive bonus points at the end. And lots of cash.[CR]* You can shoot around a wall to your right by putting your gun around the corner. You can shoot them but they cannot shoot you.[CR]Two-Player Strategies : These strategies are in addition to the general strategies.[CR]* First of all, each player is immune to the other player's shots.[CR]* If all the Xybots are destroyed, the first player that exits the maze gets the bonus.[CR]* The first player that exits the level gets a 5,000 point bonus.[CR]* If one of the players enters the warp, both players will warp regardless of the other player's location.[CR]* If one of the players dies, and the other makes it through that particular level, the other player is brought back with 50% energy. The other player also loses all the items they may have collected on that level. If both players die, the game is over.[CR]* Learn to work with each other. The combined firepower of two people is quite significant if applied the right way.[CR]* Watch each others back. When one person is facing one way, have the other face the other way in case some Xybots want to sneak up on you.[CR]* In addition, watch in directions that you are unprotected. For example, in a corner one person can look straight while the other looks to one of the sides.[CR]* Don't get greedy and have one player take everything. Learn to share items found. Also, share coins at the Supply Area so that both characters can get maximum benefits. This is a game of cooperation so treat it as such.[CR]Boss Strategies : In order to eliminate the Master Xybot, you must take out all six of his lasers.[CR]* You will be placed on a platform to the left of the Master Xybot. In front of you will be his hand with six openings in it.[CR]* These openings flash at random. When they flash, they fire shots at your character. Your goal is to hit one of these openings when it is flashing. When you do, that opening is cannot fire shots anymore.[CR]* You must run back and forth on the platform to not only avoid the laser fire, but to also shoot up the openings.[CR]* You must take out all six openings in order to defeat the Master Xybot.[CR]* On the later levels, the rate of fire from these openings gets faster.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Game designer : Ed Logg (ED )[CR]Programmers : Ed Logg (ED ), Bob Flanagan (BOB)[CR]Enginner : Doug Snyder (DUG)[CR]Technician : Cris Drobny (CAD)[CR]Animators : Sam Comstock (SWC), Mark West (MLW)[CR]Audio designers : Earl Vickers (EAR), Hal Canon (HLC), Brad Fuller (BAF)[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Nintendo NES [US] : Unreleased Prototype [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [AU] (2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [US] (October 11, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2 [Model MWO-3201W]" [CR]Nintendo GameCube [US] (October 11, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2 [Model DOL-GAYE-USA]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [US] (October 11, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2 [Model SLUS-20997]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [EU] (October 29, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [EU] (October 29, 2004) "Midway Arcade Treasures 2 [Model SLES-52844]"[CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [US] (November 6, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [US] (November 6, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins [Model BLUS-31083]"[CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [EU] (November 15, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [EU] (November 15, 2012) "Midway Arcade Origins [Model BLES-01768]"[CR]* Handhelds : [CR]Atari Lynx [US] (1991) "Xybots [Model PA2062]" [CR]Sony PSP [US] (December 13, 2005) "Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play [Model ULUS-10059]"[CR]Sony PSP [EU] (February 24, 2006) "Midway Arcade Treasures Extended Play [Model ULES-00180]" [CR]* Computers : [CR]Sinclair ZX Spectrum [EU] (1989) [CR]Commodore C64 [US] [EU] (1989) [CR]Atari ST [EU] (1989) [CR]Amstrad CPC [EU] (1989) [CR]Commodore Amiga [US] (1989) [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [US] (February 17, 2006) "Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition"[CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [EU] (March 17, 2006) "Midway Arcade Treasures Deluxe Edition" by Zoo Digital Publishing[CR]</plot>

It runs on the Neo-Geo MVS and was never released on the Neo-Geo AES home console.[CR]A serious bug: Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tileset rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the mainboard z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after gameover, on a multi-slot the games will reset.

The answers shall only be uncovered by a long &amp; fierce battle, are you up to it?[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-069[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons Per Player.[CR][Joystick] 8-way [A] Quick Punch [B] Quick Kick [C] Power Punch [D] Power Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Garou Densetsu 3 was released in March 1995 in Japan.[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Legend of Hungry Wolf 3 - The Distant Battle'.[CR]Garou Densetsu 3 overtly refers to itself by its overseas name of 'Fatal Fury 3' throughout the game.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as 'Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory'.[CR]Things that changed in this particular game:[CR]* The game introduces a deeper plane change system which proved to be somewhat clunky &amp; difficult to use due to the tricky commands used to move between planes.[CR]* Chain combos are introduced to add even more depth to each character's fighting style. [CR]* Throws are harder to use since these are slow and throw-miss animations were added.[CR]* Newcomers in the game are Bob Wilson, Blue Mary, Franco Bash, Hon Fu, Sokaku Mochizuki, Ryuji Yamazaki, Jin Chonshu &amp; Jin Chonrei.[CR]Hon Fu's goofy martial artist routine &amp; easygoing personality make him SNK's hilarious homage to Jackie Chan. Definitely not a Bruce Lee clone! :)[CR]Kyo Kusanagi &amp; Sie Kensou make a cameo in Pao Pao Cafe![CR]Pony Canyon released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Garou Densetsu 3 - PCCB-00179) on April 21, 1995.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Reach and beat Jin Chonshu with a fighting grade above "A" and you'll fight a hidden last boss, her brother, Jin Chonrei.[CR]One of the coolest things of this game is the fact that you can alter some backgrounds objects by slamming opponents against them. For example, you can knock away the training dummy in Joe's stage if you send an opponent flying towards it. Experiment on various stages to find more surprises![CR]Note : If the game is set on the USA, ASIA or EUROPE bios, the game will reset after defeating Jin Chonrei and you won't get to see the ending, however if the game is set on the JAPAN bios it will work just fine![CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Garou - Mark of the Wolves (c) 1999 SNK.[CR]The 9th 'Fatal Fury' episode brings us 12 characters and foregoes the plane-switching style of its predecessors in favour of standard single-plane battles. One of the last games produced by the original SNK.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-253[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way [A] Swift punch [B] Swift kick [C] Pummeler punch [D] Colossal kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in November 1999.[CR]'Garou' translates from Japanese as 'Hungry Wolf'. 'Mark of the Wolves' is a reference to the legacy left behind by Terry to a new generation of fighters - specifically, Rock Howard. This can also refer to the legacy left by other characters from the previous Fatal Fury &amp; Art of Fighting games. Kim Dong Hwan &amp; Kim Jae Hoon are sons of Tae-Kwon Do fighter Kim Kaphwan. Khushmood Butt is a master of Kyokugenryu Karate, the same martial used by Ryo Sakazaki from Art of Fighting. Hokutomaru uses Shiranui-style Ninjitsu as his fighting style, this is the same ninja arts that Mai Shiranui uses, however Hokutomaru was trained by Andy Bogard.[CR]Garou pushes the capabilities of the Neo-Geo MVS hardware to its limit, giving some of the best-looking graphics to date. Some critics saying that there is life after all in the Neo-Geo hardware, which was past its prime when the game was released.[CR]Hokutomaru's stage has quite a few references to the rest of the "Fatal Fury" series. To the extreme left of the stage is a billboard with a picture of the old style Terry Bogard. A portrait of Geese Howard and his lieutenants can be seen on another billboard (this is the same picture that is seen in the flyer for Real Bout Fatal Fury). There is also a picture of Andy Bogard and Mai Shiranui holding hands posing as a bank advertisement right above another picture of Alfred.[CR]The sign that Khushnood Butt shows off in his victory pose is a Kyokugen Karate dojo sign.[CR]The Rock Howard music stage contains a part of Robert Miles' seminal trance tune Children.[CR]Rock Howard is the son of the notorious crime-lord Geese Howard, the boss of previous Fatal Fury games. Rock was trained to fight by Terry Bogard and has incorporated moves from Terry and Geese's styles into his own fighting style. Rock is also related to Garou's main boss of the game: Kain R. Heinlein. Geese Howard married Marie Heinlein, whom is the sister of Kain. So, we can assume that Kain is Rock's uncle.[CR]The word 'Tizoc' (The Griffon Mask's Japanese name) means 'sick leg', or 'lame leg'. It was the name of an ancient Mexican tlatoani, or leader, who ruled from 1481 until 1486, when he was poisoned by Aztec aristocrats.[CR]If a double KO occurs, a round is won by each fighter, which can end a battle on this quite unsatisfying note. Moreover in this case, the player has no fighting level, neither displayed on the screen nor counted for the points.[CR]Soundtracks release:[CR][JP] Jan. 21, 2000; Garou - Mark of the Wolves [SCDC-00006] Scitron[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The prototype version has a white background at the title screen instead a blue background on the final version. It has also a graphic bug on the Terry Bogard stage during the second round at the extreme right.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Random Fighter : Hold Start and press a Punch or Kick button at the character selection screen.[CR]* Play as Grant : At the character select screen, highlight Dong Hwan, hold Start and press Up(x2) Down(x2), Up, Down.[CR]* Play as Kain R. Heinlein : At the character select screen, highlight Jae Hoon, hold Start and press Down(x2), Up(x2), Down, Up.[CR]* Play against Kain R. Heinlein : To reach Kain, you must finish the first 7 matches with an average fighting level of AAA. Your best bet would be to avoid losing any rounds throughout the preliminary 7 stages, especially Grant. If you meet this condition after defeating Grant, you'll get a cutscene featuring Kain R. Heinlein. Beat Kain to reveal your characters' true ending.[CR]* Alternate Costume Colors : Each character has 4 colors, corresponding to each button.[CR]* Secret Taunts : After defeating your opponent, hold Left or Right and tap Start to use an hidden taunt. Every character has two secret taunts (these can ONLY be used after defeating an opponent and before your character goes into his/her winning pose). Some of them, such as Hotaru's and Hokutomaru's are really cool! :)[CR]Taunts in the game can affect the background stages in many ways. For example, by using a taunt during a fight in Hotaru's stage (Philanthropy Belfry) you can make the bells in the background move. Most stages have hidden animations that can only be seen by this trick so try it! :)[CR]* Survival Mode : Insert a coin, hold A+B+C+D and press Start. You will then play a Survival Mode (quite hard one too).[CR]* Rock's Win-pose : Rock will have a special win-pose when he finishes the opponent with a Shine Knuckle and a different one when he finishes the opponent with either a Raging Storm or the Deadly Rave Neo.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Many years have passed since the last war with Death Adder. But, as memories of those dark times begin to fade, another war is beginning. Out of the mists of time, a magical axe is discovered. The legend of the axe is well known throughout the land, for it is told that this axe is the very one which Gillius Thunderhead used to slay Death Adder.[CR]Over time, the powers of the axe have grown. It is said that the artifact can grant its owner anything his or her heart desires. Young and old, good and evil, many are drawn towards the power of the weapon. Thus begins the war of the Golden Axe.</plot>

				<plot>Killer Instinct (c) 1994 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]10 genetically engineered fighters engage in 1-on-1 combat in a tournament arranged by the sinister 'Ultratech', the organization behind the genetic creation of the fighters. The tournament soon turns into a battle for survival.[CR]Each player starts the game with 2 energy bars, which represent the amount of health each player has for the entire game. Once the first bar is depleted, the player falls, gets up and starts to use the second energy bar. A voice will subsequently announce either 'Round Two' or 'Killer Instinct!'. The player who wins the first round gets to keep their remaining energy, and still has the second bar to use in future fights. This gives an advantage to the player who wins the first round.[CR]Killer Instinct introduced incredibly complex combos to the fighting genre, as well as including the Fatalities and Humiliations made famous by Midway's "Mortal Kombat" Series.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : R4600 (@ 100 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video Resolution : 320 x 240 Pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette Colors : 32768[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR]=&gt; [1] QP, [2] MP, [3] FP[CR]=&gt; [4] QK, [5] MK, [6] FK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Killer Instinct was released in October 1994. Manufactured &amp; sold by Midway, under license from Nintendo. Developed by Rare.[CR]This is the first arcade game to use a hard disk drive for mass storage. Killer Instinct's superbly-rendered graphics were considered to be among the finest of their day. The entire game was pre-rendered using SGI computers (Silicon Graphics Incorporated). In addition to this, the backgrounds themselves were pre-rendered as a 'movie', which simply adjusted frames based on your current location. Killer Instinct was the first game to feature 'auto-combos'.[CR]Jago is considered as Killer Instinct's version of Street Fighter's Ryu.[CR]The Glacius character design is rumoured to be influenced by the T-1000 from the Hollywood film 'Terminator 2'.[CR]The character Sabrewulf appears as an enemy in the game 'Sabre Wulf', released by Rare (known at the time as "Ultimate Play the Game) on a variety of home computers during the 1980s, and later resurrected for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance.[CR]"Cruis'n USA" and Killer Instinct were both released as public previews for the then upcoming 'Nintendo Ultra 64' console (later renamed the 'Nintendo 64'). Killer Instinct was the first game to be ported to a home console; NOT to the Nintendo 64, as intended, but to the Nintendo Super NES. This was due to the Nintendo 64's development falling severely behind schedule. Only "Cruis'n USA" would actually appear on the Nintendo 64.[CR]The Nintendo 64's hardware is totally different - and vastly inferior to - the arcade hardware that drove 'Cruis'n USA' and 'Killer Instinct' (which, incidentally, were also different from each OTHER). In the end, neither game actually represented what the Nintendo 64 console was actually capable of and the home conversions were generally considered to be a severe disappointment.[CR]Brad Russell holds the official record for this game with 477,250 points.[CR]Nintendo/Rare released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Killer Cuts - 1948-1-1 HMG) on 1995. Besides being sold separately, the soundtrack was bundled with the initial release of the Nintendo Super Famicom version of the game in limited quantity.[CR]A Killer instinct unit appears in the 2002 movie 'Comic Book Villains'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]PROTOTYPE 1 :[CR]* Software version : 4.7[CR]REVISION 1 :[CR]* Software version : 1.3[CR]REVISION 2 :[CR]* Software version : 1.4[CR]REVISION 3 :[CR]* Software version : 1.5d[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Basic Controls :[CR]Each player's fighter is controlled using six buttons and one joystick. Anyone familiar with Capcom's 'Street Fighter' series will find KI's button layout familiar. The top row of buttons are for high attacks/punches and the bottom row are for low ones. [CR]The buttons are :[CR]1 = Quick Punch 2 = Middle Punch 3 = Fierce Punch[CR]4 = Quick Kick 5 = Middle Kick 6 = Fierce Kick[CR]Pull the joystick away from your opponent to block.[CR]* Play as Eyedol (on the 1.5d chip) : Select CINDER and when the VS animation starts, hold Right on the joystick and press 1, 4, 3, 5, 2, 6. If you do it right, the game will say 'Eyedol'.[CR]* Stage Select / Music Select : After choosing the character you want with the Start button, immediately press and hold Up or Down along with one of the Punch or Kick buttons. Different combinations allow different boards. The first player to choose their character gets to choose the stage. The second player gets to choose the music with the same method. The selectable levels are as follows;[CR]Mountain Temple : (Up+LP)[CR]Dungeon : (Up+MP)[CR]Mountain Shrine : (Up+HP)[CR]Castle Rofftop : (Up+LK)[CR]City Rooftop in Chicago : (Up+MK)[CR]Desert Rooftop : (Up+HK)[CR]Canyon : (Down+LP)[CR]Altar : (Down+MP)[CR]Warehouse Basement : (Down+HP)[CR]Chicago Alleyway : (Down+LK)[CR]Castle : (Down+MK)[CR]Industrial Warehouse : (Down+HK)[CR]Desert Rooftop : (Down+Start)[CR]Sky top : Player 1 (Down MK), Player 2 (Down+MK)[CR]Boxing Gym : ???[CR]Eydol's Lair : ???[CR]Tiger Shrine : ???[CR]* Last Breath : This allows players one last chance for life, and allows them to gain enough energy to take one more hit. After the voice says 'No Mercy', the player can start rotating the joy stick and mashing the buttons. Their combatant will then get back up and start to fight again. This MUST do this before the opponent starts doing the 'No Mercy' move. [CR]* Power Up : The Power up bar is the white flashing vertical bar that is situated in the player's health bar. This allows the fighters to unleash more devastating moves, such as the Shadow moves and Triple projectiles. The bar is usually powered up by doing a combo breaker. 'Sabrewulf' can get it by doing his Energy Howl, and Spinal can get it by obtaining skulls. If the bar is NOT flashing, then the player's gither is not powered up.[CR]* Turbo Mode : During the 'Vs Animation', if both players hold the joystick to the RIGHT, and hold buttons 1+2+3. A 'swish' sound will play indicating that the TURBO mode is now active. It's also possible to activate the TURBO mode in the single player game, but the player must still do the stated actions on the second player controls.[CR]* Combo Breaker : During the 'Vs Animation' (after character selection and just prior to the bout starting), if both players push DOWN and START, the announcer says 'Combo Breaker'. Combo Breakers are now much easier to achieve.[CR]* High Scores Table : During the demo mode, press UP on both joysticks to view the high scores.[CR]* Random Character Select : At the 'Character Select' screen, press UP while pressing START and the game will select a character at random.[CR]* Different Coloured Outfits : Once you have chosen your chosen character (and have not pressed a button) moving the joystick UP and DOWN will allow you to change the colours of your player's outfit.[CR]* Humiliation (Only available if you haven't lost any energy bars during the battle) :[CR]T.J COMBO : (Stand anywhere) Down(x3), LP.[CR]JAGO : (Stand anywhere) Forward, Downforward, Down, Downback, Back, MK.[CR]GLACIUS : (Stand anywhere) Forward(x2), Back, LK.[CR]SPINAL : (Stand anywhere) Back, DownBack, Down, Downforward, Forward, HK.[CR]ORCHID : (Stand anywhere) Forward, DownForward, Down, Downback, Back, HP.[CR]CHIEF THUNDER : (Stand anywhere) Down(x3), Forward, LK.[CR]FULGORE : (Stand anywhere) Back, DownBack, Down, Downforward, Forward, MK.[CR]CINDER : (Stand anywhere) Back(x3), HK.[CR]SABREWULF : (Stand anywhere) Forward(x3), LP.[CR]RIPTOR : (Stand anywhere) Down(x2), Forward(x2), HP.[CR]* No Mercy - T.J COMBO :[CR]1.

				<plot>Killer Instinct 2 (c) 1996 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]A great sequel of the previous game include new features and new characters. [CR]The plot follows on where the first installment left off. Eyedol's death at the hands of Orchid accidentally sets off a time warp, transporting some of the combatants back in time and allowing the Demon Lord Gargos to escape from Limbo.[CR]Now, trapped 2000 years in the past, the warriors that survived Killer Instinct, along with several new faces, fight for the right to face Gargos in combat. Each character that survived the journey from the first game has a corresponding background story, while new characters on this installment are native inhabitants of this past time period. Some fighters, like T.J. Combo who survives from the original, just want to get home. Others, like new character Tusk, want to bring an end to Gargos and his reign of evil. This time there is no tournament or prize money, just a fight to the finish with the fate of the future hanging in the balance.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : R4600 (@ 100 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video Resolution : 320 x 240 Pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette Colors : 32768[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR]=&gt; [1] QP, [2] MP, [3] FP[CR]=&gt; [4] QK, [5] MK, [6] FK[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Killer Instinct 2 was released in January 1996. Manufactured &amp; sold by Midway under license from Nintendo. Developed by Rare.[CR]In addition to the already impressive amount of endings the game has, there are still a bunch of others that were never "tied into the game", according to programmer Chris Tilston. However, thanks to a text dump, they have been found. It is unknown what the conditions to unlock them were going to be. These are the unused endings:[CR]Fulgore:[CR]1) WITH ALL TASKS SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE, FULGORE WANDERS FOREVER IN THE PAST, LOST AND DEVOID OF PURPOSE.[CR]2) FULGORES FAILURE TO ELIMINATE ORCHID IS A FATAL MISTAKE, WHICH HE DOES NOT LIVE TO REGRET.[CR]3) WITH FULGORES DEATH, ALL REMAINING TRACES OF ULTRATECH ARE ERASED.

HIS QUEST TO SMASH THE EVIL THERE IS OVER - BUT AT WHAT COST...?[CR]2) TOGETHER THEY UTTERLY DESTROY THE REMNANTS OF THE ULTRATECH CORPORATION. THE FORCES OF GOOD HAVE WON AN IMPORTANT BATTLE.[CR]3) JAGO IS DEAD, BUT AT LEAST HE STOPPED ULTRATECH - OR DID HE... FULGORE HAS A NEW TARGET - JAGO'S ANCESTORS. IF JAGO WASN'T BORN, HE COULDN'T DESTROY ULTRATECH. FULGORE WILL WAIT...[CR]4) FULGORE SURVIVES AND REBUILDS ULTRATECH FROM ITS BURNING ASHES. JAGO AND ORCHID WILL RISE AND FACE THIS FOE AGAIN AS A TEAM.[CR]5) JAGO AND ORCHID UTTERLY DESTROY THE REMNANTS OF THE ULTRATECH CORPORATION. THE FORCES OF GOOD ARE VICTORIOUS ONCE MORE.[CR]TJ Combo:[CR]1) USING THE GOLD FOUND IN THE PAST HE LIVES HIS LONG LIFE LIKE A KING, FINALLY DYING AN OLD AND HAPPY MAN.[CR]2) NOBODY BELIEVES HIS STORY ON HIS RETURN, BUT HE CARES NOT. HE'S RICH, HE'S MEAN AND HE'S BACK.[CR]Spinal:[CR]1) NOT ONLY HAS SPINAL DEFEATED HIS HATED MASTER, HE HAS ALSO RECOVERED THE ARTIFACT USED TO SUMMON HIM. HIS DESTINY LIES IN HIS OWN HANDS.[CR]2) BUT WHILE HIS DESTINY CAN BE ALTERED SPINAL'S FATE REMAINS FIXED AS A VENGEFUL ENEMY ARRIVES TO SETTLE A SCORE.[CR]3) USING THE ARTIFACT, SPINAL BOLDLY RAISES AN ARMY OF UNDEAD WARRIORS. WITH FEW LEFT TO STAND IN HIS WAY, THE WORLD WILL SURELY FALL.[CR]Sabrewulf:[CR]1) BUT STUMBLING INTO THE ALIENS SHIP IS A FATAL MISTAKE. SEIZING THE CHANCE FOR REVENGE, THE ALIENS SHOW POOR SABREWULF NO MERCY.[CR]2) WITH TECHNOLOGY RETRIEVED FROM GLACIUS'S SHIP, HE FINALLY DISCOVERS A CURE AND RETURNS TO HUMAN FORM FREE AT LAST OF THE BEAST.[CR]Maya:[CR]1) WITH THE LOSS OF THE EARTH GODDESS'S PROTECTION, THE NATION OF AMAZONIA IS LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND A NEW GUARDIAN.[CR]2) BUT WITH THE EARTH GODDESS NO LONGER WATCHING OVER THEM, ONLY MAYA REMAINS TO STAND ALONE AGAINST THE ENEMIES OF AMAZONIA.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]REVISION 1 :[CR]* Software version : 1.0[CR]REVISION 2 :[CR]* Software version : 1.1[CR]REVISION 3 :[CR]* Software version : 1.3[CR]REVISION 4 :[CR]* Software version : 1.4[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play As Gargos : At the character selection screen, hold Up on the joystick, then press FP, MP, MK, FK, MP, QP, QK, MK.[CR]* Random Select : At the character selection screen, hold Up on the joystick and press the Start button.[CR]* Speed Codes : The following combinations should be held at the 'VS' screen to change the speed setting of the match.[CR]Turbo speed - Down+MP or MK.[CR]Ultra speed - Down+FP or FK.[CR]Cancel speed code - Down+QP or QK.[CR]* Stage Select / Music Select : After choosing the character you want with the Start button, immediately press and hold Up or Down along with one of the Punch or Kick buttons.

				<plot>The King of Fighters 2000 (c) 2000 SNK.[CR]34 characters, plus the popular striker system, await to be selected to team up and defeat the mighty Zero and his incredible bladed coat![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-257[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][JOYSTICK] 8-way, [A] Weak punch, [B] Weak kick, [C] Strong punch, [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 2000.[CR]About Ramon : This character was designed with one of Neo-Geo's major markets in mind, South America. He's a stout, masked wrestler who uses tricky body slam moves. These 3 points form the major concept behind the creation of Ramon. Ramon's designer at the time loved pro-wrestling fighting moves, and we remember him carefully studying these. The fruits of this labor crystallized themselves in the Lucha Dolore known as Ramon. With his use of 'Lucha Libre' moves and not those of traditional 'pro-wrestling', the staff team hope you can enjoy experiencing the attention to detail, intensity, and enthusiasm of Ramon's designer at that time.[CR]About Vanessa : Vanessa's entrance in KOF at the time put a stop to the parade of increasingly younger characters appearing in the game, especially the women characters who were all teenagers for the most part. This is the reason for creating the concept of a thirty-something woman who broke all the rules and overflowed with adult appeal. Her style has become the topic of many humorous comic strips. In her first appearance in the Sega Dreamcast version of KOF '99 as a Striker character, she was a bit irreverent. And in KOF 2000, she officially entered the tournament as a player character. Designers wanted to introduce her as a player character in KOF '99, but legend has it that she had to sit it out due to certain time constraints.[CR]About Lin : This character was selected out of the encyclopedic character background materials (whose volume would rival the Encyclopedia Britannica!) of the supervising planners. Lin is tied to the Flying Brigands 'HIzoku', who were introduced as a KOF side story in the NESTS Chronicles, but without the knowledge of the staff, and when Ron showed up in the ending sequence, there were some awfully surprised designers. With all the special moves and actions for this character the programmers and planners had a rough time working on this character. He brought tears to the eyes of the developers, but not for the usual reasons.[CR]About Seth : Seth was created as part of a set with Vanessa, appearing for the first time in the Sega Dreamcast version of KOF '99. His initial name was 'Dick'. The name had deep significance for his designer. Based on the strong wishes of the supervising designer, the powerful image of a big, dark, middle-aged man with a Mohawk haircut who used the arts of self-defense was decided on. Since Seth was created first, Vanessa's clothes were designed to match his. This made some people surmise things like Seth was Vanessa's husband.[CR]About Hinako Shijo : At first designers sought to create a character similar to Chie in the Japanese comic Jarinko Chie (Downtown Story) who used sumo moves. The supervising designer, however, succumbed to insistent requests to use 'a debutante', and Hinako gradually transformed into a wellborn young maiden. She was to fight barefoot, but that idea got eighty-sixed. The tape remaining on her fingers is a tiny remnant of her original concept. Since her appearance grew further and further away from that of a sumo wrestler, the names for her moves use those of actual sumo moves to preserve the essence of the sumo wrestler in her original character.[CR]About Kula Diamond : To add dimensions to the villainous NESTS organization of the NESTS Chronicles and excitement to the story, the need to create an enemy for the huge and individualistic K' arose. Manipulator of the 'Anti-K' Arts', her ice symbolizes the foil to the flames of K'. That's what Kula Diamond's all about. During production Designers elicited the opinions of newly hired female designers regarding Kula's mannerisms to "make her girlish gestures appropriately girlish" (but left the actual design work to the veteran supervising designer). Designers think we succeeded in faithfully depicting a 14-year-old girl... Asking Kula's designer about his impressions at the time, he immediately answered : "Kula had an easy delivery. She didn't give me any pain". The actual work appeared difficult, but it seems he enjoyed his work.[CR]About Candy Diamond : Candy is the robot you can see during Kula's Special Move displays, animated sequences, and as a Striker. Since Candy's not a player character she doesn't stand out like the other characters, but she does appear in the gut-wrenching episode that depicts her emotions for Kula when she's torched saving her mistress in the Kula ending of KOF 2000. If you haven't yet seen this, what're you waiting for? Hurry up and clear the game with Kula to find out![CR]About Zero : Zero is the boss of Krizalid from KOF '99, but his position in a company would be similar to that of 'division chief'. Because of his black beard and noble manner, designers are sure he's regarded as a rather scary 'division chief' in the organization. His guiltless betrayal of Krizalid speaks volumes about his true personality, in stark contrast to his dislike of traitors listed in his profile. Incidentally, The names of some of Zero's moves come from the Japanese anime 'Hokuto no Ken'.[CR]About Diana : Diana's the Amazon featured in Kula's sequences. She used to be a top executive for NESTS but is portrayed as Kula's guardian in the background story. If you compared NESTS to a company... designers often use this metaphor, but designers don't have a clue which position would fit her or Foxy. Judging by her loathing of elite managers (college boys), designers could say she's a 'big-sister section chief' who climbed the corporate ladder with extremely hard work. Working with a "fabulous babe" boss like her would be whack (but a bit scary, though)![CR]Robert's 'Ryuugeki Ken' is a knock-off of the Sonic Boom (It isn't in "The King of Fighters '99 - Millennium Battle" because of its looks, despite the charging motion).[CR]There are 2 symbolic things that tell you how the people at SNK were forseeing the end of their company. Kyo's theme is called 'Good Bye Esaka', Esaka is the avenue where the SNK building and Neo Geo Land are (Esaka means 'entrance to the hill'). The second thing is the destruction of the city that started all : South Town (Home of "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" and "Art of Fighting" - however, note that in "Garou - Mark of The Wolves", Second South was rebuilt near South Town. Also noted is the fact that every Kyo theme before 'Tears' had 'Esaka' in it ('Esaka' in 94, 'Funky Esaka' in 95, 'Esaka?' in 96 and 'Esaka Forever' in 97).[CR]The reason for those names is that in "The King of Fighters '94", Kyo's team stage is below a bridge in the Esaka area near SNK. In "The King of Fighters '95", they fight in front of Neo Geo Land, again, in Esaka in front of the SNK building. In "The King of Fighters '96", they fight in top of a bridge also in the Esaka area. In "The King of Fighters '97" there is no Esaka stage, however, this was supposed to be the last KOF as SNK planned to move to the Hyper NeoGeo 64, it was like a glorious farewell to KOF, however, things went different. Finally, in "The King of Fighters '98 - The Slugfest", the Esaka stage appears again; they fight below a bridge in front of the Neo Geo Land.[CR]* Origin of Alternate Strikers :[CR]Another Benimaru (Benimaru) : Alternate art for Benimaru.[CR]Another K' (K') : Alternate art for K'.[CR]Another Robert (Robert) : Alternate art for Robert (inspired from the early "Art of Fighting" days).[CR]Athena (Athena) : Athena as she appeared in her first game, "Athena".[CR]Baijang (Chin) : (Not too sure, but it could be Tung Fu Rue's panda).[CR]Billy Kane (Andy) : "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" (Andy is second banana for the good guys, Billy is second banana for the bad guys).[CR]Chizuru Kagura (Mai) : KOF, Mai's teammate in '97/'98.[CR]Chris (Whip) : KOF, part of the New Face Team.[CR]Cosplayer Kyoko (Shingo) : A girl dressing up as Kyo (in his old outfit), Kyoko is the 'feminine form' of Kyo (ie, what Christina would be to Chris) - Voice by Haruna Ikezwa.[CR]Duck King (Joe) : "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters".[CR]Duke Edwards (Ramon) : "Burning Fight" - Voice by Kong Kuwata.[CR]Eiji Kisaragi (Lin) : "Art of Fighting".[CR]Fiolina Germi (Vanessa) : "Metal Slug - Super vehicle-001".[CR]Foxy (Kula) : KOF, Kula's guardian.[CR]Gai Tendou (Takuma) : Main character in "Buriki One in Tokyo - World Grapple Tournament '99", where Ryo has a cameo - Voice by Nobuyuki Hiyama.[CR]Geese Howard (Terry) : Terry's old nemesis from "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters".[CR]Goenitz (Leona) : KOF, final boss in "The King of Fighters '96".[CR]Goro Daimon (Seth) : KOF '94-'98 (retired at the time to raise children).[CR]Kaede (Ryo) : "The Last Blade".[CR]Kang Baedal (Jhun) : Original design for Jhun - Voice by Eiji Takemoto.[CR]Kaoru Watabe (Bao) : KOF (Kaoru is an Athena fan who lost both her legs and her fan letter to Athena was what made her join the '97 tournament, Kaoru now has artificial legs, thanks to Athena) - Voice by Ayako Kawasumi.[CR]Kensou (Kensou) : Kensou as he appeared in his first game, "Psycho Soldier".[CR]Kim Dong Hwan (Chang) : "Garou - Mark of the Wolves", Kim's older son.[CR]Kim Jae Hoon (Choi) : "Garou - Mark of the Wolves", Kim's younger son.[CR]Kim Sue-Il (Kim) : "Kizuna Encounter - Super Tag Battle" - Voice by Yoshiaki Fujita.[CR]Lilly Kane (Hinako) : "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", Billy's younger sister and Joe's girlfriend - Voice by Yumi Kakazu.[CR]Li Xiangfei (Kasumi) : "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", Kasumi's teammate in '99.[CR]Mature/Vice (Iori) : Iori's teammates from '96/'98.[CR]Nakoruru (Yuri) : "Samurai Shodown".[CR]Rocky (Maxima) : Player 2's character from "Robo Army".[CR]Ryuji Yamazaki (Mary) : "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", Mary's teammate in '97/'98.[CR]Shermie (Clark) : KOF, part of the New Face Team.[CR]Shishi-Ou/King Lion (King) : Main villain in "Savage Reign" - Voice by Katsuhisa Nakatsuka.[CR]Sho Kirishima (Kyo) : Original design for Kyo.[CR]Yashiro Nanakase (Ralf) : KOF, part of the New Face Team.[CR]* Maniac Striker Origins :[CR]Another Iori (Iori) : Alternate art for Iori.[CR]Cool Choi (Choi) : Alternate art for Choi.[CR]G-Mantle (Ryo) : This character is King, appears in "Art Of Figthing 2" previous her battle in history mode.[CR]Neo &amp; Geo (Ramon) : They are not the SNK mascots :), they appear in the game "Quiz Daisousa Sen - The Last Count Down", where they are the private eyes Neo MacDonald and Geo Kentacky.[CR]Thier last names are a spoof to two Fast Food restaurant chains.[CR]Kentacky is the Japanese reading for Kentucky - Voice by Hiroyuki Arita.[CR]Rugal Bernstein (Kula) : KOF, considered to be the 'franchise boss' (much like Bison for SF).[CR]Saisyu Kusanagi (Kyo) : KOF, Kyo's father.[CR]Smart Chang (Chang) : Alternate art for Chang.[CR]Unknown (Kasumi) : "Art of Fighting", Kasumi's father (Ryuhaku Todo) - Voice by Arita Goto.[CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Soundtracks:[CR][JP] Aug. 23, 2000; The King of Fighters 2000 [SCDC-00035] - Scitron[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Japanese vs. USA differences :[CR]- Blood has been removed.[CR]- Mai's chest doesn't bounce.[CR]- The team specific ending musics have been replaced with one generic track.[CR]- The Ikari Team's ending has been modified.

				<plot>The King of Fighters '96 (c) 1996 SNK.[CR]The 3rd chapter in this groundbreaking series brings 27 classic SNK characters together against Goenitz, the final boss.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-214[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR]=&gt; [Joystick] 8-way, [A] Weak Punch, [B] Weak Kick, [C] Strong Punch, [D] Strong Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 1996.[CR]This is the first game to include special phrases and poses when two characters in particular fight. In this game, it happens only with Kyo Vs. Iori, Terry Vs. Geese and Ralf Jones vs Clark Steel.[CR]Ryo Sakazaki's fighting stance changed from the regular 'dukes up' to try and distance him from being thought of as a Ryu ripoff. His basic moves, however, remained unchanged.[CR]Yuri's Yuri Chou Mawashi Geri is a knock-off of Ryu's Tatsumaki Senpuu Kyaku.[CR]If you look at the game code for this game, you would have seen more moves that were originally planned for this game, but never made the cut (for some characters, these moves debuted in later games).[CR]Among those moves that were cut were Kyo's Saishuu Kessen Ougi 'Mu Shiki', Daimon's Arashi no Yama, Robert's Muei Senpuu Juudan Kyaku, Ralf's Umanori Vulcan Punch, Clark's Running Three, Geese's Deadly Rave and Choi's Hou'ou Kyaku.[CR]Geese's music (Geese ni Katakori) is a remixed version of his Fatal Fury 1 theme music (Geese ni Kiss).[CR]A remixed version of Big Shot! (originally Terry's theme music in "Fatal Fury 3 - Road to the Final Victory") was used as the Fatal Fury Team's music.[CR]About Leona : Along with the extensive overhaul to the team lineup of KOF '96, Leona entered the series as a replacement for Heidern, leader of the Ikari Team. Introducing the plot element of Heidern's adopted daughter had been dreamed up by the game designers before the production of KOF '96, and the details surrounding her origins gradually came to include a crucial role as a descendant of the Orochi tribe. Designed with the ardent love of her designers, Leona's special moves are markedly unique compared to the other characters, and reveal the particular tastes of her designers.[CR]About Mature : She used to be Rugal's secretary. For the chief game planner at the time, it seems that both she and Vice were given the image of the 'ruthless woman' and the 'cruel woman' respectively, but when they became actual characters things got a little hectic, and someone came up with, 'Rugal had a secretary, didn't he. Make it two and run with that'. So these two characters came into being (Talk about slacking off). Consequently, they received additional characteristics : they were actually spies sent to observe Rugal and the descendants of the Orochi 8ketsu Clan.[CR]About Vice : If Mature was the 'ruthless woman', Vice was to be the 'cruel woman'. The official illustrations for Vice and Mature remain extremely popular, and we're glad we could supply our fans with these images that cannot be reduced to pixels. The period of development for KOF '96 dragged on right up to the time of its scheduled release. At the location test for this title, Mature and Vice were still not included in the game. It's not that they were hidden, but there wasn't enough time to insert them into this initial version (we can talk about this calmly now, but at the time...forget about it!).[CR]About Goenitz : In spite of the fact of Goenitz's sole official appearance in '96, he continues to have a considerable following of fans to this day, making him one of KOF's most popular characters. With strength that surpasses Rugal, the boss character of '94 and '95, the episode of the young Goenitz taking out the eye of Rugal was added to the game's story. Rugal, in turn, relieved Heidern of one of his eyes, which makes us think that SNK sure seems to have a lot of one-eyed characters, witness Gilbert, Jubei Yagyu, and Ramon. If you look carefully at the Goenitz the designer drew at the time (with a little help), you'll notice the shiver-inducing moment in which Goenitz appears to have six fingers.[CR]About Geese Howard : The dream event for SNK's most recognizable characters! ...and what dream event would be complete without the appearance of Geese? Naturally, he's the character who people hope appears in the game each year, and there were plans to have him appear in KOF '95 long before. Various considerations at the time, however, led developers to abandon this plan. Then, with the time being ripe, Geese reappeared in KOF '96. Even throughout the game, this boss team received special treatment : things like leitmotif music were prepared for each member and at the time of this title's release, enthusiasm for this game reached a feverish pitch. Numerous special moves were prepared for Geese, but in view of the memory capacity and time required for adjustments, a good number of Super Special Moves had to be left out. A waste, really...[CR]About Wolfgang Krauser : In KOF '96 the Boss Team was formed! And with that, Krauser entered the tournament, teaming up with his half brother Geese... but at the time, in terms of memory limitations and the KOF system of that time, it was a tough environment to faithfully depict the Krauser of Fatal Fury. Developers still cringe remembering the numerous criticisms, big and small, regarding the Fatal Fury Team's treatment. KOF '96 saw the debut of Krauser as a player character, but in the ending sequence he did make a cameo in KOF '94.[CR]About Mr. BIG : For a variety of reasons, the Krauser of KOF got a bad rap, but BIG received favorable reviews from the fans. BIG is an austere villain brimming over with adult appeal-that's the character of Mr. BIG. The behavior of the women who hang with him also is based on a certain video the designers of the time often watched. The woman mutters, "He's bad", but just what does that actually mean? The truth remains a deep mystery. During the development stage, a positive slide for his Super Special Moves included one labeled "Spinning Stick Thrust, Kind of Like an Anti-Air Assault". We'd like to think that the move wasn't scrapped because of the vagueness of its name, but it's too bad the general public never got to see it. It rocks![CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The King of Fighters '96 - PCCB-00223) on 21/08/1996.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Alternate costume colors : press D when selecting a fighter on the character selection screen.[CR]* Select victory pose : press a Punch or Kick button immediately after winning a match.[CR]* Finish the game using one of these combinations to see the special endings :[CR]1) Chizuru, Kyo, Iori[CR]2) Goenitz, and 2 more characters except Chizuru[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

In this new opus : Yuri's new special attack 'Shin! Chou Upper' is a knock off of Ryu's Shin Shoryuu Ken. She also has a movement similar to Terry's burn knuckle. Finally, her Forward+A is a parody of Sakura's Flower Kick.[CR]KOF98 contains pieces of music from older KOFs.[CR]For example, the character select music when a second player joins in is straight from KOF 96 (it's called Roulette).[CR]Here's a complete list of themes, the teams (or individuals) they belong to and the games they were taken from :[CR]Esaka? (Japan Team) : KOF 96 (Japan Team's theme music).[CR]Esaka (95-style Kyo Kusanagi) : KOF 94 (Japan Team's theme music).[CR]Kurikinton (Fatal Fury Team) : Fatal Fury 2 (Terry Bogard's theme music).[CR]Art of Fight (Art of Fighting Team) : Art of Fighting (Ryo Sakazaki's and Ryuhaku Todo's theme music).[CR]Rumbling in the City (Ikari Team) : KOF 96 (Ikari Team's theme music).[CR]Shin! Senritsu no Dora (Psycho Soldier Team) : KOF95 (Psycho Soldier Team's theme music).[CR]Fairy (Gals Fighters Team) : KOF 96 (Chizuru Kagura's theme music).[CR]Seoul Town (Korea Team) : Real Bout Fatal Fury (Kim Kaphwan's theme music).[CR]Bloody (New Face Team) : KOF 97 (New Face Team's theme music).[CR]Rhythmic Hallucination (Orochi Yashiro) : KOF 97 (Orochi New Face Team's theme music).[CR]C62 (Ryuji Yamazaki) : Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Ryuji Yamazaki's theme music).[CR]Blue Mary's Blues (Blue Mary) : Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Blue Mary's theme music).[CR]London March (Billy Kane) : Real Bout Fatal Fury Special (Billy Kane's theme music).[CR]Arashi no Saxophone (Iori Yagami) : KOF 95 (Revenge Team's theme music).[CR]Arashi no Saxophone 2 (Mature, Vice) : KOF 96 (Iori Team's theme music).[CR]Slum No. 5 (USA Sports Team) : KOF 94 (USA Sports Team's theme music).[CR]Still Green (Shingo Yabuki) : KOF 97 (Shingo Yabuki's theme music).[CR]Ketchaku R&amp;D (Omega Rugal) : first half from KOF 94 (Rugal Bernstein's theme music), second half from KOF 95 (Omega Rugal's theme music).[CR]Ne! ('94 Gals Fighters Team) : KOF 94 (Gals Fighters Team's theme music).[CR]Also to note that the music that is played prior to facing Rugal (Kettou R&amp;D) is also from KOF 94 (as the theme for Rugal's first form).[CR]When Choi Bounge appears, a 7 seconds sample from a song is played. This song is 'Choi Bounge Ondo', which appeared in the KOF 97 Arrange SoundTracks. The song became quite popular in Japan.[CR]Mr. Big from "Art of Fighting" makes a small cameo appearance in the USA Wharf background, during the first rounds.[CR]About Kyo Version 95 : Because the introduction of different versions for this character included as "hidden features" in KOF '97 was such a hit with fans, designers thought, another version of Kyo in KOF '98 would make the game more inviting. Designers also remember that both versions for Kyo Kusanagi for game tests were equally popular. This concept for different versions of this character subsequently became the basis for the 'Kyo clones'.[CR]In the Japan Street stage, during the second round if you look in the middle of the background where some shops are, you can see tiny moving people who look like Iori, Mai and Terry Bogard. In the third and fifth round, you can see two people doing hand signals, they look similar to Kyo Kusanagi &amp; Shingo Yabuki. In the fourth round, you can see Mai and Terry.[CR]A serious bug : Using a USA bios rom if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neo+geo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attact loop after game over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.[CR]Leona, Ralph and Clark are playable characters in the Foma 90x Series Mobile Phones game 'Metal Slug Survivors'.[CR]Soundtrack releases:[CR][JP] Aug. 19, 1998; The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends [PCCB-00334] - Pony Canyon.[CR][JP] Sep. 18, 1998; The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends Arrange Sound Trax [PCCB-00337] - Pony Canyon.[CR](JP] Oct. 07, 1998; The King of Fighters '98 - Dream Match Never Ends Drama CD [PCCB-00339] - Pony Canyon.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]At the Intro music (CIPHER) and the Staff Roll BGM (ZERO) a sample used says 'mot*er fu**er'.

				<title_clean>Fighters - Mortal Kombat II</title_clean>
				<plot>Mortal Kombat II (c) 1993 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]Mortal Kombat II is a direct sequel to the 1992 original featuring new fighters (increasing the character roster from 7 to 12) and improved graphics. [CR]As with its predecessor, MKII's matches are divided into rounds, with victory awarded to the first player to win two rounds. At the point of defeat, the losing fighter will become dazed and the winner is given the opportunity to execute a 'finishing move'. [CR]Some of the standard fighting moves (moves shared by all characters) have now been expanded or enhanced. A crouching punch has been added and the 'roundhouse kick' is more powerful and now knocks opponents across the screen. Also, the difference in hit boxes between high and low kicks is now more marked. [CR]Additionally, returning characters gain new special moves and MKII marks the first appearence of multiple Fatalities - as well as additional, non-lethal finishing moves - in the series. In addition to the Fatalities of its predecessor, MKII offers 'Babalities' (turning a defeated opponent into a crying baby), 'Friendships' (a non-malicious interaction, such as dancing or giving a gift to the defeated opponent) and stage-specific Fatalities (the winner uppercutting their opponent into an abyss below, spikes above, or a pool of acid in the background). [CR]Each character still shares generic attributes - speed, power, jump height and airtime - albeit with differing hit boxes. The sequel drops the points system of its prequel in favour of a consecutive win tally.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Midway T Unit hardware[CR]Main CPU : TMS34010 (@ 6.25 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : ADSP2105 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : DMA-driven (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 5[CR]=&gt; [1] High Punch, [2] Block, [3] High Kick[CR]=&gt; [4] Low Punch, [5] Low Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Mortal Kombat II was released in April 1993 in USA.[CR]MKII was the first Midway release to use the DCS Sound System. [CR]'Noob Saibot' backwards spells 'Boon' and 'Tobias' who are the names of the principle game designers. [CR]'Jax' was originally supposed to be in the original "Mortal Kombat" game and named Kurtis Stryker. Jax was then moved to MKII and the Stryker character debuted in "Mortal Kombat 3". [CR]'Kintaro' was originally intended to be a humanoid tiger, similar to the creature in Japanese mythology. This idea was scrapped, however, due to the fact that creating the costume would not have been feasable. However, thanks to this original idea, the Shokan we know as Kintaro has the tiger stripes on his back. [CR]Real life : Philip Ahn, who played the regenerated Shang Tsung, is in fact a doctor. [CR]Three of the cast members for MKII filed a lawsuit against Midway shortly after the game was released. The claim? The physical instructors/martial artists Elizabeth Malecki (Sonya Blade), Catalin Zamiar (Kitana/Milenna) and Philip Ahn were under the impression that they were hired under typical acting contracts and were entitled to a small modicum of benefits including royalties of title sales, etc. The plaintiffs banded together against Midway, who took the case to court. Eventually the judge failed on Midway's behalf, citing that the work done by the plaintiffs for Midway was done strictly as a 'work-for-hire' and Midway owned all the property and benefits on the characters/titles/etc. As a consequence, all three left the project, and were recast for "Mortal Kombat 3". [CR]SFII / MK2 : both games were supposed to be released within weeks of each other (at this time, "Street Fighter" and "Mortal Kombat" were the dominant fighting games). Capcom released "Super Street Fighter II - The New Challengers" early so that they could attract fans away from MK. At the same time, Midway released MK2 early for similar reasons. As you can see, the result meant that both came back to square one.[CR]One of Jade's clues references Chun Li from Street Fighter "Chun who?"[CR]'Friendships' and 'Babalities' (see 'Tips And Tricks' section for more info) in MKII were used in making light of the violence controversy in the first "Mortal Kombat" game. [CR]Two non-existent hidden characters were 'Torch', and 'Hornbuckle'. In MKII there is a location called 'The Pit II'. Far in the background of this stage there is another bridge across the chasm. Standing stationary on this bridge are two fighters : one of them is a Liu Kang sprite with green pants who was named Hornbuckle by fans. One of Jade's hints was 'Hornbuckle who?', which people thought was the name of a hidden fighter, and was apparently given to the guy opposite 'Torch' on The Pit II. If you watch the ending credits, one of the programmers' last names is Hornbuckle. The other fighter is a humanoid character that seems to be made of fire. As these two characters never move, it has been suggested that the 'other fighter' is actually a funeral pyre. Finally, there is a cloaked figure who floats in front of the window during fights in The Tower and Portal stages in MKII. This character was dubbed Cloak by fans, and was assumed to be a hidden character. The character of Torch, who had been very popular with fans, eventually showed up as a playable character in "Mortal Kombat : Deadly Alliance". Unfortunately, due to trademark issues, he had to be called Blaze instead of Torch.

But for some of the characters' names that were NOT changed, there were alternate pronunciations recorded.[CR]For example, when you select Chun-Li in the original Japanese version, the way the announcer pronounces 'Chun' rhymes with 'noon'. [CR]In the Export versions, the way she pronounces 'Chun' rhymes with 'fun'. There is also an unused alternate pronunciation of Zangief (which sounds like 'Zain-geef') that can be heard in the Sound Test. [CR]Megaman's 'Rock Upper' move in the original Japanese version is called 'Mega Upper' in the Export versions, simply because the name of the character is different in Japan and Worldwide.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Blue Board revisions : [CR]REVISION 1:[CR]* Build date: 971222[CR]* US release.[CR]REVISION 2:[CR]* Build date: 980112[CR]* EUROPE release.[CR]REVISION 3:[CR]* Build date: 980123[CR]* US &amp; EUROPE releases.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Sega Dreamcast [US] (September 30, 1999) "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model T-1202N]" : Re-released as Sega All Stars edition (2000)[CR]Sony PlayStation [US] (January 27, 2000) "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model SLUS-01059]" [CR]Sony PlayStation [EU] (January 31, 2000) Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model SLES-02305]" [CR]Sega Dreamcast [EU] (June 23, 2000) "Marvel vs. Capcom - Clash of Super Heroes [Model T-7002D-61] [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [PSN] [US] (September 25, 2012) "Marvel vs. Capcom Origins" [CR]Microsoft XBOX 360 [XBLA] [US] [EU] [AU] (September 26, 2012) "Marvel vs. Capcom Origins" [CR]Sony PlayStation 3 [PSN] [EU] (October 10, 2012) "Marvel vs. Capcom Origins"[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Fighters - The Outfoxies</title_clean>
				<plot>The Outfoxies (c) 1994 Namco.[CR]A platform 'versus' shoot'em up in which either one player (playing against the computer) or two players (playing against each other) attempt to destroy each other by any means necessary. The levels themselves are interesting and varied, with airships, planes etc. providing a detailed and highly interactive backdrop in which the players do battle. That interactivity is increased further with the introduction of destructible sections which, when blown up, can often open up new areas or rooms. Each level is littered with a variety of weapons that can be picked up and utilized by the player(s). Graphically, Outfoxies employed superb sprite scale and rotation techniques that elevated the already fun gameplay still further. The aeroplane level, for instance, dips and sways, bringing problems of inertia and gravity to the platform action. Also; the in-game camera zooms in and out of the level, depending on how far away the two opponents are from each other. Playable characters range from a monkey to a pair of psychotic school children, with each character choice offering the player different aptitudes (the monkey can jump higher, for example). A fun enough game in one-player mode, Outfoxies really came into its own when two human protagonists took part.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Namco System NB-1 hardware[CR]Game ID : OU[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68EC020 (@ 24.192 Mhz), M37702 (@ 16.128 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : C352 (@ 16.128 Mhz)[CR]Control per player: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons per player: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Even if the titlescreen says '1994', The Outfoxies was released in March 1995 in Japan.[CR]Victor Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (The Outfoxies : Namco Game Sound Express Vol.20 - VICL-15042) on 21/06/1995.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Concept and design : Masateru Umeda[CR]Main programmer : Yoshiyuki Honda[CR]System programmer : Toshiharu Hijita[CR]Game programmer : Koichi Motokoide[CR]Character designer : Miki Maemori[CR]Field designer : Taro Okamoto[CR]Music and sound effects : Masahiro Fukuzawa[CR]Graphic designer : Akira Usukura[CR]Logo designer : Hideaki Ito[CR]Chief directorer : Masuya Ohishi[CR]Product manager : Shinichiro Okamoto, Hajime Nakatani[CR]Producer : Akihiko Tokue, Shukuo Ishikawa[CR]Visual works : Yukiko Kaneko, Nobuko Endo, Muneyuki Tejima, Mitsuru Fukuoka, Tomoe Yamashita, Hisaharu Takahashi, Takashi Imaizumi, Hitomi Kusano, Kazuaki Fujimoto, Kanako Doi, Daisuke Tsushima, Kyoko Endo, Tomosuke Kashiwabara[CR]</plot>

[CR]The concept of the game borrows heavily from Taito's 1992 arcade unit "Dino Rex". [CR]Atari had intended to create another upgrade for PR 2.3 and was scheduled at this time for January 1995. This upgrade would allow the player to face a boss monster at the end of the game for total domination of the world. The final boss was supposed to be a horned dracolich (animate dragon skeleton) imprisoned in the moon, with three claws on each limb and 3 spines on the end of his tail. It was also supposed to have the powers of flight and the ability to drain the opponent's lifeforce. The final battle ground would be a moon scene with the skeletons of numerous dinosaurs laying around in decaying states. The ground would be covered with craters and giant, glowing cracks. A teleportation warp would exist overhead. Unfortunately, Atari scrapped the idea for this upgrade because Time Warner Interactive been too busy at this time to work on an upgrade and the boss was never came into existence... :( [CR]The June 1996 issue of GamePro magazine confirms that Ellie Rovella of Gilbert, Arizona became enraged when her 11-year-old son bought Primal Rage for his Sega Genesis and played the game using GamePro's strategy guide to execute Chaos' golden shower fatality. Rovella was so outraged she not only returned the game, but also launched a grass-roots campaign. As part of this, the fatality was famously censored on the Super Nintendo version by placing a large 'censored' bar over the screen when it was performed.

				<plot>Real Bout Garou Densetsu 2 - The Newcomers (c) 1998 SNK Corp.[CR]23 of the finest South Town fighters in the 7th installment of this SNK game.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-240[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Punch [B] Kick [C] Power Attack [D] Move Between Planes[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]This game was shown at the 1998 AOU Amusement Expo show, in Japan. it was then released in March 1998.[CR]The title of the game translates from Japanese as 'Real Bout Hungry Wolf Legend 2'.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as 'Real Bout Fatal Fury 2 - The Newcomers'.[CR]Things that changed in this particular game :[CR]* The game now features 'single plane' stages (like the ones seen in "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters", "Fatal Fury 2" &amp; "Fatal Fury Special") in which you can slam enemies against background objects![CR]* The breakable objects system seen in Real Bout Special is gone. Also the "evil character" versions of some characters are gone as well.[CR]* Newcomers in this game are : Li Xiangfei, Rick Strowd &amp; Alfred.[CR]A serious bug : Using a USA bios ROM if you insert a coin on the 'winners don't use drugs' screen on a single slot the games will use the neogeo bios s1 tile-set rather than the game tiles, this causes most of the graphics to be hidden and the games to be unplayable, it will also end up using the main-board z80 bios so sound will be broken, the games should fix themselves if you let them run another attract loop after game-over, on a multi-slot the games will reset. This is one of the first 4 'gigapower' games, the bug was fixed after that.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Real Bout Garou Densetsu 2 The Newcomers / PCCB-00310) on April 17, 1998.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Fight against Alfred : Begin game play in single player mode, finish off the first 10 fights with no losses, score over 750000 by the time the 10th fight is won, land 5 P.POWER moves or 7 S.POWER moves. You will fight Alfred in a desert type stage.[CR]* You may scope out each character's best records by tapping A button to move forward or B button to move back at the score ranking screen :).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Rage of the Dragons (c) 2002 Playmore Corp.[CR]Rage of the Dragons is an original fighting game with 14 selectable fighters plus Abubo (sub-boss, hidden character) and Johann (final boss).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-264[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Weak Punch, [B] Weak Kick, [C] Strong Punch, [D] Strong Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in June 2002, Rage of the Dragons is the first fighting game developed by Evoga Entertainment. This game is a collaboration between Evoga (Mexico), Brezza Soft (Japan) and Noise Factory (Japan).[CR]Evoga tried to make a new "Double Dragon" game and attempted to acquire the rights to "Double Dragon" from Technos Japan but they refused to sell. Without the proper rights to use the Double Dragon property, Evoga decided to do a game that pays homage to the Double Dragon series instead. For example, William 'Billy' Lewis, James 'Jimmy' Lewis and 'Abubo' are analogous to the characters Billy Lee, Jimmy Lee and Abobo from "Double Dragon". One funny thing about these Evoga characters is that they appear in Noise Factory's "Matrimeele", which is based on the Power Instinct series by Atlus.[CR]Pupa Salgueiro &amp; Cassandra Murata are the only characters in the game that have two super moves instead of just one. These being the Ultimate Quexada (for Pupa) and a ground version of the White Wave (for Cassandra).[CR]Linda, the famous lady with the whip in the Double Dragon games makes an appearance as one of Abubo's girlfriends in his intro pose as well as in the second Abubo cutscene.[CR]Alice Carroll's name seems curiously inspired in the famous children's book "Alice in Wonderland" and by the name of its author Lewis Carroll. Odd...[CR]Jones features many funny references to Bruce Lee such as his outfit (Bruce Lee's famous outfit in the 'Game of Death' movie), a few of his moves &amp; poses, and a suspicious quote in his ending! :)[CR]The stage of Radel and Annie is a night club called 'Noise Factory' just as one of the 3 companies which worked on the game.[CR]On the parking lot stage, there is a TV screen displaying credits for a movie. It contains Engrish text 'Special Sanks' instead of 'Special Thanks'.[CR]Noise Factory released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Rage of the Dragons Original Arrange Album) on 13/09/2002.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Abubo : at the character select screen, press quickly Up(x4), Down(x3), Left(x2), Right. A little melody indicates that the cheat worked and Abubo should appear on center.[CR]* The game encourages the use of team up attacks. In fact, by finishing each opponent with a team up attack will get you some nice grades &amp; a respectable score! (perfect lifebars with this tip will get you a handsome SSS grade every time!!!) :)[CR]* Jones' air version of his First Impact combo is broken against Alice since the last hit will always miss! Beware! :/[CR]* Johann, the last boss in the game cannot be dizzied since he lacks a dizzy animation, this can be seen by performing a team up attack on him. This makes this already cheap boss even harder to defeat! :/[CR]* After each battle, a rank is determined based on your fighting level. Here are the different levels and the bonus points awarded to the player if he reaches them :[CR]SSS : 100,000 points[CR]SS : 75,000 points[CR]S : 50,000 points[CR]A : 25,000 points[CR]B : 10,000 points[CR]C : 7,500 points[CR]D : 5,000 points[CR]E : 0 point[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producer : Boss[CR]Directors : Angel Sword, Mamaro, Hidenari Mamoto[CR]Sub.

				<plot>Samurai Spirits Zero Special (c) 2004 SNK Playmore.[CR]An 'upgrade' of the Samurai Spirits Zero episode with its 24 fighters plus 4 more characters : Amakusa, Gaoh, Zankuro and Mizuki. It's probably the ultimate game released on MVS since SNK Playmore decided to develop its future games on AtomisWave.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-272[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Light attack, [B] Medium attack, [C] Kick/Break defence, [D] Lie down/Forward roll/Back roll/Small jump/Dodge[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Samurai Spirits Zero Special was released in April 2004 in Japan.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as 'Samurai Shodown V Special'.[CR]The original version of the game contain some bugs and characters don't have fatalities. To correct that, SNK Playmore released corrected cartridges (without any problems) which can be recognized by a small NeoGeo sticker on the top right[CR]On the game box, SNK put the following message : 'A final Farewell. To all of our customers, who have purchased NeoGeo rom cartridges up till now, thank you very much. We offer our most heartfelt gratitude for your loyal patronage over these 14 full years and hope for your continued support for our games on the many other platforms we will provide products for in the future. NeoGeo fans rule!'.[CR]Some rumors says that SNK Playmore wanted to release an other upgrade of "Samurai Shodown V" on NeoGeo MVS called "Samurai Shodown V Special Final" including 2 new characters, some new stages and the correction of all the original game's bugs. A location test occurred in Tokyo in october 2004 but then SNK Playmore denied developing this game.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* I'm Not Afraid Of You! : think you are really good? Tap Start 3 times quickly to make your character drop his/her sword. Now show your opponents that the most fearsome weapons are the ones you were born with![CR]* The game has several last bosses: Amakusa,  Zankuro, Gao and Muzuki. In order to reach the latter bosses, you need to perform a fatality on the former ones. If you don't, you'll instead get a bad ending.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

The full US name for the game is "Samurai Shodown III - Blades of Blood".[CR]Kafuin Gaira is a Buddhist monk whose weapons are giant 'mala', or Buddhist prayer beads. When Gaira wins the first round of a match, he throws a few punches and says 'Tenchu!', which means 'retribution!'. Gaira says a traditional Buddhist prayer for his fallen opponent when he wins the final round of the match. 'Namu amida butsu', Gaira's prayer, is basically 'go to heaven' or 'rest in peace'.[CR]Shizumaru Hisame is a homage to Himura Kenshin (a character from the manga 'Rurouni Kenshin').[CR]Zankuro Minazuki is a homage to Raijyuta Isurugi (another character from 'Rurouni Kenshin').[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Zankuro : This tip only works in 2-Player mode.

				<plot>Street Fighter III - 3rd Strike : Fight For The Future (c) 1999 Capcom.[CR]New characters Remy, Makoto, Q, and Twelve join the returning Street Fighter veteran Chun-Li and the existing "Street Fighter III - 2nd Impact : Giant Attack" cast in this third and final installment of Street Fighter III.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Capcom Play System III hardware (CPS III)[CR]CD Number : CAP-33S000[CR]CD Label : CAP-33S-1[CR]Main CPU : Hitachi SH2 (possibly 2)[CR]Storage : SCSI CD Rom, RAM and Flash ROM.[CR]RAM : SIMMs on the left w/ 16M of data each (each has 8x 16M Flash ROMs, there's 4 SIMMs plugged in on this board).

The mistake then appears again when the screen scrolls to display the next opponent choice.[CR]Shin Akuma is present in the game code. Shin Akuma in 3rd Strike differs somewhat from his 2nd Impact guise. For a start, in 2nd Impact Shin Akuma had his own audio samples. In 3rd Strike, he shares Akuma's soundfile. His second Super Art is somewhat glitchy at times, and unlike 2nd Impact, he seems to have only 2 outfits. The blue color outfit is for Player 1, and the white colour outfit for Player 2. Both are hardcoded.[CR]This is also the first Street Fighter game to adopt a rap/hip hop urban theme.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]VER. 990512[CR]* Ken Vs. Makoto neutral throw bug : If Ken defeats Makoto with his neutral throw (i.e. knee bash), the game will reset.[CR]* Chou Denji Storm graphical glitch : P2 Yang has 'Chou Denji Storm' listed as one of his Super Arts instead of 'Tenshin-Senkyutai'.[CR]* Unblockables : Certain characters (Urien, Oro) have moves/combos which are impossible to block.[CR]VER. 990608[CR]* Ken Vs. Makoto neutral throw bug has been fixed and doesn't reset the game.[CR]* Unblockables are no longer unblockable.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* 6 Costume Colors : Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and press one of the 6 buttons for the standard outfits (button 1 aka LP is the original color).[CR]* Secret Colour : Highlight a fighter at the character selection screen and press LP+MK+HP.[CR]* Play Against Q : Get at least five super art finishes and you cannot lose any rounds. However, you can get the grade at least D or above, and at least two special points needed. If done correctly, Q will appear and you will fight him on the stage you fought in (Also now Q's theme is playing).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Street Fighter (1987)[CR]2.

				<plot>Soul Calibur (c) 1998 Namco, Limited.[CR]The mystical sword of the legends, the "Soul Edge", ended up in the hands of the dreaded pirate Cervantes de Leon of Spain. For the next 25 years he stayed dormant on the remnants of a Spanish port town, taking the souls of those who reached him during their search of the sword. His reign of terror was soon to start, but through the joined efforts of Greek divine warrior Sophitia Alexandra and Japanese kunoichi Taki, he was stopped and killed, with one of the twin Soul Edge blades being shattered in the process. As it was about to tear itself apart, young Prussian knight Siegfried Schtauffen approached the port town and battled Cervantes, whose corpse had been momentarily reanimated through Soul Edge's will. After emerging victorious, Siegfried's attention turned unto the sword. The moment he took the hilt of the cursed blade, Soul Edge released a bright column of light into the sky. This was known as the "Evil Seed", bound to bring calamity and death in its wake.[CR]Three years after those events, Soul Edge uses Siegfried as its host, and now Siegfried is Nightmare, a knight wearing azure armor and sporting a hideously deformed right arm. Europe plunges into a vortex of slaughters as he and his followers claim souls to strengthen the blade in its weakened state. Unknown to them, a group of warriors met on their journey to stop Soul Edge, and with them three sacred weapons join once again.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Namco System 12 Hardware[CR]Game ID : SOC[CR]Main CPU : PSX (@ 16.9344 Mhz), H8/3002 (@ 14.7456 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : C352 (@ 14.7456 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; Horizontal Slash, Vertical Slash, Kick, Guard[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Soul Calibur was released on July 30, 1998.[CR]Soul Calibur adopted the 'Tekken-style' of character unlock, with a huge hidden roster that was unlocked by leaving the game on for months...

				<plot>SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom (c) 2003 Playmore Corp.[CR]A one-on-one fighting game - the collaboration between Capcom and SNK - pits seventeen well-known SNK combatants against seventeen of Capcom's most famous game characters.[CR]'SVC Chaos' primarily utilizes the command system of the "King of Fighters" series, incorporating light/strong kicks, punches, cancels and charging attacks. Unlike its predecessor, however, "Capcom vs. SNK 2", SvC features no air guards and lacks a 'groove system', instead focusing on quicker game play and online competition.[CR]Each character is equipped with a basic three-bar system for executing 'Exceeds' (special attacks), with basic filling options attributed to strikes and damage. Additionally, the sprites from the various series received new models and some special effects were changed in the command lists (For example, the player can no longer increase the damage of the 'Zujou Sashi' used by Choi Bounge by tapping the buttons).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-269[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR]=&gt; [A] Weak punch [B] Weak kick [C] Strong punch [D] Strong kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in July 2003.[CR]Here are the 17 SNK characters (plus Evil Mr Karate) and their first appearance in video games :[CR]Athena Asamiya - "Athena"[CR]Choi Bounge - "The King of Fighters '94"[CR]Earthquake - "Samurai Shodown" ("Samurai Spirits" in Japan)[CR]Iori Yagami - "The King of Fighters '95"[CR]Kasumi Todoh - "Art of Fighting 3 - The Path of the Warrior" ("Ryuuko no Ken Gaiden" in Japan)[CR]Kim Kaphwan - "Fatal Fury 2" ("Garou Densetsu 2 - Arata-Naru Tatakai" in Japan)[CR]Kyo Kusanagi - "The King of Fighters '94"[CR]Geese Howard - "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" ("Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai" in Japan)[CR]Genjyuro Kibagami - "Samurai Shodown II" ("Samurai Spirits II" in Japan)[CR]Goenitz - "The King of Fighters '96"[CR]Mai Shiranui - "Fatal Fury 2" ("Garou Densetsu 2 - Arata-Naru Tatakai" in Japan)[CR]Mars People - "Metal Slug - Super Vehicle-001"[CR]Mr Karate - "Art of Fighting 2" ("Ryuuko no Ken 2" in Japan) as Takuma Takazaki[CR]Orochi Iori - "The King of Fighters '97"[CR]Ryo Sakazaki - "Art of Fighting" ("Ryuuko no Ken" in Japan)[CR]Shiki - "Samurai Shodown 64" ("Samurai Spirits 64" in Japan)[CR]Terry Bogard - "Fatal Fury - King of Fighters" ("Garou Densetsu - Shukumei no Tatakai" in Japan)[CR]There are also 17 Capcom characters (plus Shin Akuma) and here are their first appearances:[CR]Akuma (Gouki in Japan) - "Super Street Fighter II Turbo" ("Super Street Fighter II X" in Japan)[CR]Balrog (M. Bison in Japan) - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"[CR]Chun-Li - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"[CR]Dan Hibiki - "Street Fighter Alpha - Warriors' Dreams" ("Street Fighter Zero" in Japan)[CR]Demitri -  "Darkstalkers - The Night Warriors" ("Vampire - The Night Warriors" in Japan)[CR]Dhalsim - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"[CR]Guile - "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior"[CR]Hugo - "Final Fight"[CR]Ken Masters - "Street Fighter"[CR]M.

SNK 2 - Mark of the Millenium 2001".[CR]Bao (from the King of Fighters series) makes a cameo in a few of Hugo's pre-battle and win poses.[CR]The Athena that features in SVC Chaos is the original Athena character design that featured in the character's debut platform game, "Athena", instead of the usual Asimaya Athena that appears in virtually every other SNK game. Notably, a lot of her moves are now very different, and she wears noticeably less clothes due to the fact Athena loses her dress during Athena's intro. Athena's fighting moves are inspired by the manga/anime 'Saint Seiya'.[CR]The 'Sennou Ken' character is based on the psycho-controlled Ken in the SF animated movie. A lot of Mars People's moves are references to numerous UFO-based staples; Independence is a reference to the movie 'Independence Day', for example.[CR]The 'Dan Hibiki' character is once again used as a vehicle for numerous genre parodies. If you perform his super-taunt he parodies Joe Higashi and Yuri Sakazaki's taunts. Also, two of his new moves are parodies of the Kyokugen moves. In the first of these moves, Dan attempts to do one of the larger fireballs performed in one Ryo's desperation move, but it has the same range as his regular fireball. On the second move, Dan attempts to perform his own powerful punch similar to Ryo's Exceed move, but after the move charges and connects Dan grabs his arm in pain and then pretends it was nothing.[CR]While using Demitri, if you perform Midnight Bliss on Orochi Iori, Iori will turn into Miss X (from SNK Gal Fighters on the Neo Geo Pocket) as he's choking him.[CR]Suleputer released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game on November 2003.[CR]Some well-known hacks of the game include :[CR]"SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom Plus".[CR]"SVC Chaos - SNK Vs. Capcom Super Plus".[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Random Select : On the character select screen, hold Start to activate a roulette-like feature.[CR]* Play as Geese : Hold Start and press Left(x3), Down, Left, Up, Right, Up, then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Dan : Hold Start and press Down, Left(x7), then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Goenitz : Hold Start and press Down(x3), Right, Down, Left(x3), then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Demitri : Hold Start and press Right(x3), Left, Up, Right, Down, Up, then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Mars People : Hold Start and press Up, Down, Right(x3), Up, Down, Left(x2), Down, then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Zero : Hold Start and press Up, Right(x2), Left(x2), Down, Up(x3), Right, then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Orochi Iori : Hold Start and press Up(x3), Down, Left, Right, Down, Left, then press a button to select.[CR]* Play as Violent Ken : Hold Start and press Up(x2), Down, Left(x2), Right, Left, Up, then press a button to select.[CR]* Fight against Red Arremer :[CR]1) Finish 5 rounds with supers/specials.[CR]2) Do not lose any rounds.[CR]3) Finish off at least one character with block damage.[CR]If done correctly, your character will be transported to Hell after the fight with Shin Akuma/Shin Mr. Karate, where he/she will have to fight Red Arremer. Note : Some people (like Dan and Demitri) have alternate endings for fighting and winning in Hell.[CR]* Fight either Mars People or Zero : Don't lose any rounds, Don't win any rounds by "Time Out", win 3 rounds by using an Exceed Move.[CR]* Fight Geese Howard or Demitri Maximoff : Don't lose any rounds, Don't win any rounds by "Time Out", win 1 round by using an Exceed Move.[CR]*Fight Goenitz or Dan Hibiki : Fail to meet either of the above requirements.[CR]Also your opponent on Stage 6 determines who you will fight in Stages 7 and 8.[CR]* Fight Orochi Iori (Stage 7) and Serious Mr. Karate (Stage 8) : Stage 6 opponent is a Capcom character.[CR]* Fight Violent Ken (Stage 7) and Shin Akuma (Stage 8) : Stage 6 opponent is an SNK character.[CR]* Fight Athena : Don't lose any rounds during Stages 1 through 7, Don't win any rounds by block damage.[CR]* Mid-Bosses : your performance in Stages 1 through 3 affects who you will fight in Stage 4.[CR]* Final Bosses : your performance in Stages 1 through 7 affects if you'll fight either Athena or Red Arremer (in Stage 9) after beating Stage 8 (Shin Akuma or Serious Mr. Karate). Your performance in Stage 8 will not affect any of these conditions.[CR]* See character's true/good ending : Defeat Athena or Red Arremer in Stage 9. If you lose to Athena or Red Arremer then you cannot continue. Many characters (such as Dan and Demitri) have different endings for beating either Athena or Red Arremer.[CR]* CPU Character Patterns : before you start the game the CPU randomly picks one of the predetermined patterns of opponents. This affects stages 1 through 3 and 5 &amp; 6. Stage 4 is the predetermined mid-boss. Here are the predetermined pattern of fighters.[CR]Pattern 1 : Kim, Dhalsim, Mai, Bison, Kyo[CR]Pattern 2 : Vega, Earthquake, Chun-Li, Choi, Ryo[CR]Pattern 3 : Shiki, Balrog, Kasumi, Sagat, Iori[CR]Pattern 4 : Guile, Genjyuro, Tessa, Kim, Ken[CR]Pattern 5 : Tessa, Sagat, Mr. Karate, Chun-Li, Ryo[CR]Pattern 6 : Chun-Li, Kasumi, Hugo, Mr. Karate, Guile[CR]Pattern 7 : Mr. Karate, Hugo, Shiki, Dhalsim, Terry[CR]Pattern 8 : Choi, Mai, Vega, Genjyuro, Akuma[CR]Pattern 9 : Kasumi, Chun-Li, Shiki, Tessa, Mai[CR]Pattern 10 : Earthquake, Vega, Akuma, Ken, Ryu[CR]Pattern 11 : Dhalsim, Hugo, Kyo, Balrog, Iori[CR]Pattern 12 : Iori, Guile, Bison, Kim, Ken[CR]Pattern 13 : Ryu, Balrog, Kim, Sagat, Ryo[CR]Pattern 14 : Terry, Choi, Earthquake, Genjyuro, Guile[CR]Pattern 15 : Kyo, Ken, Ryo, Ryu, Terry[CR]Pattern 16 : Balrog, Vega, Sagat, Bison, Akuma[CR]So let's say the CPU randomly chooses Pattern 16 (which interesting enough follows the boss pattern of Street Fighter II plus Akuma), you would fight Balrog, Vega, and Sagat in stages 1 through 3, fight the mid-boss in stage 4, fight Bison and Akuma in stages 5 through 6, and then fight Orochi Iori and Serious Mr. Karate in stages 7 through 8 (since the stage 6 opponent was a Capcom character).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Tekken 2 (c) 1995 Namco.[CR]Two years after winning the original 'King of the Iron Fist' tournament, Kazuya Mishima decides to hold a second tournament in an attempt to finish off his father, Heihachi Mishima, in this sequel to 1994 original.[CR]The gameplay in Tekken 2 is identical to that of its predecessor, with one or two players fighting over a series of 3D-rendered backdrops. As before, the fighting system utilises four attack buttons: left punch, right punch, left kick and right kick. Certain button combinations will initiate both standard and special grab and throwing moves.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Namco System 11 hardware[CR]Game ID : TES[CR]Main CPU : PSX (@ 16.9344 Mhz), M37702 (@ 16.384 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : C352 (@ 16.384 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 640 x 480 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 65536[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in August 1995.[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Iron Fist 2'.[CR]Angel is still called Devil until the Sony PlayStation release.[CR]Jun Kazama and Kazuya Mishima aren't connected by any other way other than the fact that Kazuya is the son of Heihachi, who is the owner of the Mishima Zaibatsu and Jun is a worker at a world wildlife NGO. During the Tekken 2 Tournament, Jun Kazama and Kazuya Mishima marry (Namco never elaborated on the nature of their relationship, seeing as how they faced each other in Tekken 2 as opponents). After their marriage, Kazuya is killed by his own father who was jealous of him because Kazuya had the 'devil' inside him which Heihachi has been trying to capture for a long time. Jin is a born after a little time. He is trained by Heihachi... during this Jin's mother is killed by the God of fight (Toshin) or originally 'Ogre' (Ogre appears in the next sequel, "Tekken 3"). Jin keeps practicing until he is 18 and he then participates in Tekken3 to take the revenge of his mother and fathers death. The story continues...[CR]NEC Avenue released 2 limited-edition soundtrack albums for this game (Tekken 2 Strike Fighting Vol.1 - NACL-1225 &amp; Tekken 2 Strike Fighting Vol.2 - NACL-1229) respectively on 29/06/1996 and 20/07/1996.[CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game (Serial number M450). It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on Apr. 24th, 2009.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]REVISION 1 :[CR]* Software version : TES2/VER.A[CR]* Build date : 19 :01 :47, AUG 3 1995[CR]* Green text for timer, round, insert coin etc.[CR]* No sound when being thrown by another character (like "Tekken").[CR]REVISION 2 :[CR]* Software versions : TES2/VER.B, TES3/VER.B[CR]* Build date : 10 :39 :16, SEP 29 1995[CR]* Yellow text for timer, round, insert coin etc.[CR]* AI is modified, opponents' sound effects were added to almost all throws.[CR]* Added some new moves, listed below.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Basic throws can be escaped by pressing the same buttons as the corresponding throw. A LP+LK throw is escaped by pressing LP+LK, and a RP+RK throw is escaped by pressing RP+RK.[CR]* Special throws, as well as back throws, cannot be escaped - use these when in close quarters, but don't abuse them or people (and the CPU) will start ducking under them.[CR]* Ultimate Tackle (Paul, Kazuya) can be escaped with RP+RK. The running tackle cannot be escaped however.[CR]* Non-grab throws also cannot be escaped :[CR]Body Press (Jack-2, P.Jack, Kuma)[CR]Frankensteiner (King, Armor King, Roger/Alex)[CR]Run Up To Drop (Law)[CR]Whirlwind Toss (Wang)[CR]Slow Power Punch Combo (Michelle, Wang)[CR]Machine Gun Cannon (Michelle)[CR]Running Tackle (all)[CR]Attack Reversal (Nina, Paul, Jun, Wang, Anna) - 'Chicken' move added in Tekken 3 to counter throw[CR]* Tekken 2 also has a few bugs in its moves database :[CR]Hammer Punch (Paul, Heihachi, P.Jack). Can be done facing backwards. You can also continue to the Power Punch by following with RP.[CR]Geta Stomping (Heihachi). Can be done facing backwards, opponent must be on ground.[CR]Sledge Hammer (Bruce). Can be done facing backwards.[CR]Face Crushing Knee (Bruce). On Ver.A machines this causes a sound bug against the opponent, who will use another character's voice half way through.[CR]Killer Beam (Devil/Angel). Can be done facing backwards (both standing and flying versions).[CR]Special throws (all). Throws like King's Tombstone Pile Driver can be done backwards by reversing the directional input as though you're facing the opponent.[CR]* Play As Hidden Characters (even if they aren't selectable yet) :[CR]Wang : On the character select screen, highlight Jun/Baek (whoever's default), then press Start, Down, Right, Left, Up[CR]P.

Roger will appear if your character was selected with a punch button, Alex if selected with a kick button.[CR]* Fight Kuma on Stage 4 : If you have Roger or Alex and do the same thing Kuma will appear instead.[CR]* Each character has a sub-boss (stage 8) depending on who started the game :[CR]If Jun (default) was chosen Wang will be on stage 8. Baek is in place of Jun if the "New Character" setting is set to 'Baek &amp; Lei'.[CR]If Yoshimitsu was chosen, Kunimitsu will be on stage 8.[CR]Nina : Anna.[CR]Law : Baek or Jun depending on the "New Character" setting.[CR]Heihachi : Lee.[CR]Paul : Kuma.[CR]Jack-2 : P.

				<plot>Tekken 3 (c) 1996 Namco.[CR]The world's 19 toughest fighters enter The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, in order to defeat Heihachi, and Ogre, who has taken the souls of many of the world's greatest fighters to adopt its own fighting style. Every character has his own ambition of winning the tournament. A fully 3-D game with one on one concept of fighting.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Namco System 12 hardware[CR]Game ID : TET[CR]Main CPU : PSX (@ 16.9344 Mhz), H8/3002 (@ 14.7456 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : C352 (@ 14.7456 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 6[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Tekken 3 was released in March 1997 (even if the titlescreen says 1996).[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Iron Fist 3'.[CR]This is the first Tekken game which has 3-D backgrounds. Namco's Tekken 3 production team used one of the most advanced motion capture apparatus and facilities at its time for the highly life-like movements, moves, actions and reactions of the 3-D characters. They also used some of the very famous and active personalities of different martial arts styles from all over the world, like, for Eddy Gordo's Capoeira style of fight they got the services of Master Marcelo Pereira of 'Capoeira Mandinga'. And for Hwoarang's Taekwondo style of fight they got the services of Hwang Su-Il of 'Japan International Taekon-do Federation, and several other martial arts institutes.[CR]Namco's production team motion captured each and every move to create such an in depth game, that was also one of the most higly anticipated fighting game for the last few years. After Tekken 3, its followers like Tekken Tag, Tekken 4 and Tekken 5 got more and more depth, life-like impression, and the element of giving more fun (and addictiveness to its players).[CR]The word Tournament on the 'You are the Champion!' background is mis-spelled in the Japanese version as 'Tounament'.[CR]Most of the characters like Jin, Law, Julia are the children of the characters from the first Tekken games.[CR]In the Sound FX there is the announcer voice for Jun Kazama, Kazuya Mishima and Sake meaning these characters could have been in the game but weren't added to the final version.[CR]There are 21 different characters, but Anna, Tiger and Panda play identical to Nina, Eddy and Kuma respectively. In total, excluding Anna, Tiger, Panda and Mokujin, there are 17 characters with different moves.[CR]With a cheat enabled sometimes you can face Jun and a new character, Sake (pronounced Shaa-Ke). In fact Jun has a graphic for the VS. screen and a name tag for the energy bar. Uses Nina's body and Jin's moves Sake only has a name tag. Uses Yoshimitsu's body and Jin's moves, and a blank VS. picture. You can play with them with the code enabled. You'll have to find the value which the cpu uses to select your character. The value for Jun is 17 in Hex that will be (11). After you've played with Jun or Sake in the game you can see Jun and Sake in the Percentage Screens which appear in the game randomly when nobody is playing. Jun has got her Percentage Page's thumbnail but sake uses Paul's thumbnail. In the same way, after you've played with Jun and/or Sake you can see them in the EDS screen from the Dip-Switch menu. It looks like Namco was putting Jun and Sake but then stopped working on them for some purposes (explained below) :[CR]1) According to the story Jun gets killed by Ogre (the god of fight). So if they would've put her they couldn't put Jin in the game as he probably looks of the same age of his mother. That doesn't apply to TekkenTag which has both Jin and his mother Jun, because TekkenTag does not have any storyline and the idea is to put all the characters from previous games (some of them were even dead).[CR]2) Sake was rather populating the game as the game had already got 20 characters at that time. Namco's production team probably didn't had much time to re-do the whole code for character selection so they buried the two raw characters in an as-is condition forever...[CR]A cameo of this game seen is in the 2000 movie 'Dude, Where's My Car?'. A "Tekken 3" cabinet can be briefly shown in the arcade scene.[CR]Wonder Spirits released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Tekken 3 arcade soundtrack 001 ex - WSCAX-10001) on 18/07/1997.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]TET2/VER.A (World)[CR]TET3/VER.A (US)[CR]* Build date : 07:56:12, MAR 10 1997[CR]TET2/VER.B (World)[CR]* Build date : 01:58:34, MAR 25 1997[CR]TET1/VER.E1 (Japan)[CR]* Build date : 12:18:11, MAY 15 1997[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]When a Time Release character is about to become selectable the vs. screen before a demo fight will say "Coming Soon" and display a picture of the hidden character.[CR]* Play as Anna Williams : Highlight Nina on the character selection screen and press Start.

				<plot>Tekken Tag Tournament (c) 1999 Namco.[CR]Tekken Tag Tournament is a 'Dream Match' Iron Fist Tournament, and it does not have a plot fitting within the Tekken story timeline. The game is an enhanced version of Tekken 3 including a new Tag feature - where the player selects two fighters and can change between characters during gameplay, and perform tag-team combos. The first side to have a character to be knocked out is the loser. The character list includes almost (if not all) characters from all 3 previous games.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Namco System 12 hardware[CR]Game ID : TEG[CR]Main CPU : PSX (@ 16.9344 Mhz), H8/3002 (@ 14.7456 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : C352 (@ 14.7456 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 5[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in June 1999.[CR]The title of this game translates from Japanese as 'Iron Fist Tag Tournament'.[CR]This game has a tag play system (i.e. : one player can play select a team of two players) and then during a match he can tag their characters at any time, provided they aren't in the air being juggled ;). Unlike the other Tekken games, this episode has no specific storyline and the main idea behind the game was to create a game which has all the characters from Tekken 2 and Tekken 3 plus a few new characters, Tetsujin and Unknown. Tetsujin is a metallic form of Mokujin and is selected with button 1. Tetsujin will become gold if you get 10 wins in a row. Unknown is the end character, complete with a wolf, and cannot be selected on the arcade version. Tekken Tag Tournament has a total of 38 characters. When the machine is turned on for the first time, by default only 20 characters are playable. The rest of the characters are released one by one after specific time. The characters can be tagged by pressing button 5.[CR]In the Sound FX there is the announcer voice for Doctor Boskonovitch, Doctor Abel, Devil Kazuya and Marshall Law meaning these characters could have been in the game but weren't added to the final version. Since Devil Kazuya and Marshall Law are identical to Kazuya and Forest Law respectively there was no reason to add the same characters twice. Dr. Abel was an evil scientist who re-animated Bryan for Tekken 3 and was never in any game at all. For Boskonovitch, who would want to play as him on a coin operated game anyway![CR]When Tetsujin/Mokujin was updated for Tekken Tag, they forgot to add moves for Roger. This was fixed in "Tekken 5".[CR]Anna plays the same as on Tekken 3 (Sony PlayStation) and not the arcade where she was a gfx swap of Nina.[CR]Bandai Music Entertainment released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Tekken Tag Tournament Original Soundtrack - APCG-4046) on 21/09/1999.[CR]Tekken Tag Tournament can clearly be heard in the 2003 movie PTU. Characters heard fighting are Hwoarang and Wang.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Just like "Soul Calibur", the build date wasn't updated although the game was.[CR]TEG1/VER.A3 (Japan)[CR]* Build date : 22:20:05, JUN 18 1999[CR]TEG1/VER.B (Japan)[CR]TEG3/VER.B (US)[CR]* Build date : 22:20:05, JUN 18 1999[CR]TEG3/VER.C1 (US)[CR]* Build date : 22:20:05, JUN 18 1999[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Tekken Tag Tournament has every character from "Tekken 2" and "Tekken 3" (not "Tekken"). If a character was in both Tekken 2 and 3, the Tekken 3 version of the character is in TTT. Each character has from two up to five different costumes. Each costume is set with a different button. Player 1 outfit is LP, P2 outfit is LK, P3 outfit (if any) is RP, P4 outfit (if any) is RK, P5 outfit (if any) is Tag or Start button. Usually P1 and P3 outfits are similar, as are P2 and P4 outfits.[CR]Characters with 2 outfits : Kazuya, Baek, Bruce, Roger (P2 Alex), Jack-2, P.Jack, Wang, Unknown (not selectable)[CR]Characters with 3 outfits : Devil (P3 Angel), Ganryu, Kunimitsu, Jun, Armor King, Michelle, Lee, Anna[CR]Characters with 4 outfits : Yoshimitsu, Nina, Hwoarang, Paul, King, Lei, Julia, Bryan, Gun Jack, Kuma (P2-4 Panda), Heihachi, Tetsujin (P2-3-4 Mokujin), Ogre, True Ogre, [CR]Characters with 5 outfits :Xiaoyu, Jin, Law, Eddy (P5 Tiger)[CR]* Select Jin and Heihachi as a team, now with Jin do Back+LP+RP, when you see the Kazama fury animation do RP(x2), LK... Jin will change into Devil Jin, You can see the changing as Jin gets lightening all around him and his stance changes to that of Heihachi. The animation is kool but if you move forward or backward or get hit the animation will end.[CR]* Tag Throw : Press RP+Tag together. Throw differs depending on character who tags in.[CR]* Start with Tag partner : Hold Tag before the stage loads or the next round starts.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Tekken (1994, ARC)[CR]2.

				<plot>Virtua Fighter (c) 1993 Sega.[CR]In this 3-D fighting game, the game's battle system is simple, yet complex. There are 3 buttons : Punch, Kick and Guard. Movement is strictly confined to a horizontal plane.[CR]Battles are won by draining the energy bar of your opponent or by pushing your opponent off the edges of the ring (known as a 'Ring-out').[CR]When a 'Draw' is declared (timer reaches zero with both fighters having an equal amount of energy), a Sudden Death match is held on a very small platform, making a win by Ring-out that much more probable.[CR]The game favours tactical play over mindless button bashing, and the gameplay is balanced accordingly to reflect this.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "Model 1" hardware.[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Virtua Fighter was released in December 1993. An instant success in Japanese arcades, Virtua Fighter (or VF for short) brought the versus beat 'em up kicking and screaming into the next generation. Like "Street Fighter II - The World Warrior", a substantial number of clones ("Toshinden", "Tekken", "Dead or Alive") would follow in its wake, each with their own tweaks to the formula.[CR]Among the game's many innovations, the most profound were the true-to-life animation (all the more impressive considering no motion capture technology was used) and the realistic movesets of the game's eight characters.[CR]Virtua Fighter serves 180,000 polygons per second. This is the first 3-D polygonal one-on-one fighting game.[CR]During Virtua Fighter's development, the game featured an Arabian fighter named 'Siba'. He was replaced later on in the final prototypes by Akira, as the developers felt that the game needed a karate fighter similar to Street Fighter's Ryu. Siba was brought back an unlockable character in the Saturn game 'Fighter's Megamix', in all his VF1 style glory.[CR]Soundtrack releases:[CR][JP] March 23, 1994; Virtua Fighter - Saikyou no Senshi [TYCY-5386][CR]Literatures:[CR][JP] June 10, 1994; Gamest No.117: Virtua Fighter[CR][JP] August 24, 1994; Virtua Fighter Maniax [ISBN4-89366-264-3][CR][JP] December 6, 1994; Virtua Fighter Maniax Replays [ISBN4-89366-300-3][CR][JP] January 10, 1995; Virtua Fighter - Ougi no Sho [No. 147][CR][JP] January 30, 1995; Virtua Fighter Maniax for Windows [ISBN4-89366-315-1][CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Dural : First, you must beat the computer Dural and have 2 games worth of credits in the machine ready to go. After beating the game, have one player press Start and pick a character. As soon as that character finishes smiling, but before the game actually starts, player 2 should press Start to interrupt the process. If your timing is perfect, and the stars are perfectly aligned, and you've been a good boy or girl, player 2 may come in as Dural.[CR]* See Credits : You can get the credits of the programmers to come up on the screen by holding down a Start button during the demo. When it comes to the standard  demo w/ Sarah kicking Kage, the credits will come up.

				<plot>Alex Kidd With Stella - The Lost Stars (c) 1986 Sega.[CR]Alex Kidd: The Lost Stars features Alex Kidd and Stella (controlled by player 2) searching for the twelve Zodiac signs. Alex's mission is to run through each level, knocking down enemies, and obtain the six miracle balls. These balls are hidden inside such unusual places as golden eggs, the Fantasy Zone ship out of action, clamshells, Christmas presents, pumpkins, and desk bells. Levels include Toy World, Machine World, the World of Make Believe, Water World, and Monster World.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "System 16A" hardware.[CR]Game ID: 317-0021[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in December 1986 in Japan.[CR]This game is the debut of Sega's first mascot, Alex Kidd who mostly appeared in various games for the Sega Master System. Alex's only game that was made for the Sega Mega Drive was "Alex Kidd in the Enchanted Castle" in 1989. Alex Kidd's last game was titled "Alex Kidd in Shinobi World" which was somewhat of a crossover between the Alex Kidd series and Shinobi. In 1991, Alex Kidd was replaced with a 'faster than a speeding bullet'-type character called Sonic The Hedgehog.[CR]Opa-Opa, the main character from "Fantasy Zone", appears as the container for the 'Miracle Ball' in round 2 of this game.[CR]Sony Music Entertainment / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Sega Arcade 80's Vol.1 - SCDC-00245) on 19/02/2003.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Protected PCB (set 1 in MAME) : specific platforms in gameplay move upward.[CR]Unprotected PCB (set 2 in MAME) : specific platforms in gameplay move downward.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<title_clean>Platformers - Arabian</title_clean>
				<plot>Arabian (c) 1983 Sun Electronics.[CR]You'll have 1001 hours of fun with the ARABIAN upright game! You are the adventurous Arabian prince, and your goal is to rescue the princess from her palace. Use the joystick control and the KICK button to move through perilous passages. Sail the seas, crawl in caves, and fly magic carpets - you'll be challenged by 4 increasingly hard waves of play! Score points on the way for picking up the letters in A-R-A-B-I-A-N, and get a bonus if you pick them up in order![CR]Arabian is a 'video book' with a happy ending! The attract mode introduces the story, and animated storybook 'pages' let you experience the Arabian Prince's adventures. Use the 8-position joystick to jump, super-jump, walk, crawl, or climb in all directions. Tap either KICK button (are you right- or left-handed?) to kick your enemies out of the way.[CR]The player controls a young Arabian Prince who must rescue his Princess from the castle tower where she is being held prisoner. Evil Genies in brass jugs, swooping Rocs, and purple ghostly creatures called Oscars will try to stop him along the way. The Prince scores points for kicking Oscars or Rocs, picking up lettered jugs, or spelling A-R-A-B-I-A-N. The Prince loses a life when he's hit by a smokeball, falls off a ledge, flying carpet or vine, or gets caught (touched) by a Genie, Oscar, or Roc.[CR]The Prince must successfully complete 4 levels to rescue the Princess (4 levels or 'pages' equals 1 section). Each level is introduced with the turning of a page, which shows a distant view of the upcoming playfield. Each playfield has 7 lettered jugs that must be picked up before the player can advance to the next level, but he must avoid or KICK evil Genies, Oscars, and Rocs that will try to stop him.[CR]Page 1. Page l turns, revealing a ship. The Prince must work his way to the crow's nest at the top of the mast before the vessel reaches the shore. As he climbs up the rigging, Rocs and Oscars dive at him in an attempt to knock him down. The Prince must KICK them out of the way to survive. While contending with these rascals, he must also try to collect all the jugs with letters on them. Beware! The jugs hold devilish Genies which can appear at any time and throw smokeballs at the Prince. Once a Genie has materialized, the Prince's kicking power cannot be used against him and he is unable to collect the jug so he should avoid the Genie. However, the Prince may collect the jug while the Genie is in smoke. When the Arabian has collected all the jugs and reaches the top of the ship, Page 2 introduces the second level of the story.[CR]Page 2. Now the Arabian has arrived on shore. To reach the Princess he must complete a cave maze under the cliff. Low-hanging rocks and climbing vines force him to crawl and climb. The Prince must still dodge Rocs, Oscars, and the Genie's smokeballs. And he must still collect the brass jugs. When he reaches the top of the cave, he must try to collect the letter N jug.[CR]Page 3. Now the Arabian Prince must scale the walls of the castle. As flying carpets whiz by, the Arabian must jump from one to the next, taking care he isn't knocked off his present perch by another carpet flying too closely He can duck to avoid them, but his timing has to be precise or he will take a tumble down to the ground. He must still dodge Rocs, Oscars, and the Genie's smokeballs. The player must beware - sometimes a pair will merge into one super Roc bird or super Oscar![CR]Page 4. The Prince has at last entered the castle. The Princess beckons him from high in the tower. To reach her, he must ride atop some flying carpets and pull himself up ropes - all the while collecting the brass jugs and kicking meddlesome Rocs and Oscars. When he reaches his loving and grateful Princess, the 2 fly happily into the sunset on a magic carpet.[CR]Once the player has taken the Arabian through a section (all 4 levels), the next section begins. But the action gets faster, the Genies are angrier and fling more smokeballs, and there are more intelligent and challenging Rocs and Oscars. Even the brass jugs are rearranged so that it becomes more difficult for the player to spell A-R-A-B-I-A-N in order.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Cabinet dimensions : 71'' (180,34cm) High x 26,75'' (67,95cm) Wide x 25,25 (64,14cm) Deep.[CR]Cabinet weight : 307 lbs (139,3 kg)[CR]Game ID : TVG13[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Arabian was released in June 1983 in Japan.[CR]Chuck Futtrell holds the record for this game with 219,750 points on November 24, 1984.[CR]Bug : Pixels are missing from the top of the '5'.

But if he collects jugs in sequence to spell A-R-A-B-I-A-N, he'll score many more bonus points.[CR]* Kicking a Roc or Oscar into other Rocs or Oscars awards higher points.[CR]* When a Genie begins to appear, the player should move to an area which allows him to avoid the smokeballs the Genie will throw![CR]* Try to kick off the monsters in pairs for more points. They don't have to be close together : one hitting another knocks the other off screen.[CR]* Don't move through a crawlway when there is a blob regenerating on the other side. You move much slower when crawling, can't kick and chances are you won't make it through in time.[CR]* You can kick monsters slightly above and in front of you if you kick when jumping.[CR]* If you jump onto a ladder you land on it half way up and can then continue climbing, thereby getting you up quicker.[CR]* You can't jump when there are vines above you as you cling to them.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Nintendo Famicom [JP] (July 25, 1985) "Super Arabian [Model SS1-4500]" [CR]* Computers :[CR]Commodore C64 [EU] (1984) "Tales of the Arabian Nights" by Interceptor Micros[CR]Amstrad CPC [EU] (1985) "Tales of the Arabian Nights" by Interceptor[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Platformers - Athena</title_clean>
				<plot>Athena (c) 1986 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].[CR]This is a pretty hard platform game where you take the role of Athena fighting your way through different worlds inhabited by all kinds of different enemies, ranging from moving pears to huge golems and flying devils.[CR]You start out with nothing more than your feet to fight with and no more protection than Athena's underwear (she actually loses her dress in the intro to the first world) but can collect a huge number of different weapons and armour, as well as a great number of power-ups ranging from the usual more-power-for weapon or armour, through boots that allow her to jump higher and wings for flying, to one where Athena becomes a semi-god and actually growths to twice her usual size and gets a huge burning sword and full armour.[CR]The worlds are filled with stone blocks that can be smashed when searching for secrets and items, as well as several levels connected by ladders or other means of transportation.[CR]Athena is a great game, and will give even the most hardened platform-player a real challenge, for it is NOT an easy game, even with the dip switches in 'Easy' mode.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 'UP'[CR]Main CPU : (2x) Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) YM3526 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; Sword, Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Athena was released in July 1986.[CR]The main character, Athena, appears in The King of Fighters series.[CR]The 'Athena' logo on the title screen appears in 1991's "Sengoku" by SNK. In level 2, there is a store called 'Boutique Athena' in the background with the original 'Athena' logo.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Test mode : hold START during machine boot.[CR]* Something not found in the manual to this game is that there exists a 'secret' mode of the game - if you set dip switch 7 of bank 2 to 'ON' you will get one life less than usual (2 instead of 3 or 5), but the life meter will start at 22 and not 12 or 14 which is the standard. This will make the game much more interesting.[CR]* Every time you die you loose every equipment you collected up to that point, unless you also have a 'K' Item in your inventory. If you have it, when you die you will only loose the 'K' but keep the rest of the items.[CR]* There is a secret level that can be reached collecting a magic key on the Ice, Hell or Sky world. Other may exists. This world is called 'World of Labyrinth'.[CR]* When you complete the 'World of labyrinth', you will meet an angel. Do NOT attack her, but wait until she drops an harp. If you collect it, it will work as a perpetual 'K' item, and you will never loose your items again when you die.[CR]* When you complete the 'World of labyrinth', you will be returned to the level following to the one you picked up the key on.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Raguy (c) 1991 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.[CR]Raguy is an environmentally-themed side-scrolling platform game for one or two players. [CR]The player controls a heroic young man named 'Blue' (in the two-player game the second player controls 'Princess Fa', who has identical powers to Blue), whose peaceful home planet of 'Raguy' has been invaded by the evil Daruma tribe. The Daruma are polluting the planet as they consume its dwindling resources and it falls on Blue and the Princess to stop them and save Raguy. [CR]Both Blue and Princess Fa have the ability to stun enemies by hitting them with a large leaf. Once stunned, they can be picked up and thrown as projectiles at other enemies. Blue and Princess Fa can also shrink in size in order to access hidden areas, but they are not able to stun enemies while shrunk. If only one player is shrunk, they can be picked up by the other player and thrown as a projectile at the enemies. [CR]Flowers, bonus items and power-ups are littered throughout the levels. The flowers are the game's form of currency and can be used in the shops that are located throughout the game.

				<plot>Bonanza Bros. (c) 1990 Sega.[CR]Bonanza Bros. is a strategic platform shoot-em-up with one or two players taking on the roles of Robo and Mobo, two cat-burgling brothers who must negotiate scrolling platform-based levels and steal a set number of valuable items, before making their way to the roof to escape in a waiting airship. The location of the items is highlighted on a cut-away map displayed in the middle of the screen and each stage must be completed within a set time limit.[CR]The game's 2D platforms are displayed using forced-perspective 3D, this allows both the players and enemies to move between the front and back of the platforms. The game's enemies have a limited field of vision, making it possible for players to hide from them by ducking into alcoves, stairwells and other background scenery. Players can walk, jump and shoot and enemies can be neutralized either by being shot, or by slamming doors against them. They will only remain stunned for a few seconds, however. [CR]"Bonanza Bros." promotes the use of stealth, with enemies alerted by sounds or by players entering their field of vision. Once alerted, enemies will either hide, call for help or fire at the players. On some stages, hazardous items litter the ground that should either be avoided or jumped over. These include discarded Coke cans, banana skins and garden rakes and if players walk into them, they will slip and fall, creating a noise and alerting nearby guards to their presence. Some guards carry a riot shield and can only be hit when they are walking away from the player. If players get shot too many times, or if they fail to steal all treasure items and reach the escape point within the time limit, the brothers end up in jail and it's game over.[CR]The game has a total of twelve stages, with extra bonus stages appearing after every second level. These bonus rounds take place on a single screen and the aim is to collect treasure items from a number of ledges within a set time limit. Search lights constantly move around the screen and if one touches the player, the bonus round ends. Each bonus screen has alcoves that players can hide in to evade the search lights.[CR]Each of the game's twelve stages is set in a different building. The stages are: [CR]* BANK[CR]* MILLIONAIRE'S MANSION[CR]* CASINO[CR]* MINT[CR]* DEPARTMENT STORE[CR]* GOLD MINE[CR]* JEWELLERY STORE[CR]* LABORATORY[CR]* DELUXE LINER (YACHT)[CR]* ANTIQUE SHOP[CR]* ART MUSEUM[CR]* PYRAMID[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "System 24" hardware.[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Bonanza Bros. was released in June 1990.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version differs from other territories with the addition of the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen displayed at the start of a game.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Sega Master System [EU] (1990) "Bonanza Bros.

				<title_clean>Platformers - Bomb Jack</title_clean>
				<plot>Bomb Jack (c) 1984 Tehkan.[CR]Bomb Jack is a fast-moving platform game in which the aim is to collect all of the bombs on each level before progressing to the next. A variety of constantly spawning mechanical enemies patrol the platforms and airspace so the longer a player takes to collect all of the bombs, the more difficult progress becomes. [CR]Extra point bonuses are awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Only one bomb at any time has a lit fuse, and collecting twenty or more of these lit bombs on any given level will earn the player points bonus (see TIPS AND TRICKS for details). Jack is pursued around each level by the spawning enemies and when he gets killed, he drops down to the nearest platform, always landing on his head. [CR]A 'Powerball' appears at semi-regular intervals and moves diagonally around the screen. If the player manages to grab this, all of the level's monsters are frozen for several seconds and can then be killed by having Jack fly into them (similar to the 'Powerpill' feature in "Pac-Man"). Collecting the Bonus 'B' symbols will increase the amount of points awarded for collecting bombs with their fuses lit. Picking up an 'Extra' symbol awards the player with an additional life, while catching the 'Special' symbol will give the player an extra credit. [CR]Each of Bomb Jack's levels feature one of five different background pictures, some of which represent famous historical landmarks. They are: the Sphinx in Egypt, the Acropolis in Greece, Castle Neuschwanstein in Bavaria, skyscrapers and a cityscape by night. While the backgrounds themselves are repeated as the game progresses, the platform layouts for each level are completely different. At least until level 18, after which the levels are repeated. [CR]The basic play mechanic of collecting objects to clear a level, as well as the powerball feature, is hugely reminiscent of Namco's seminal "Pac-Man".[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.072 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (3x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1 (JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Bomb Jack was released in October 1984.[CR]The original idea for Bomb Jack was conceived by Michitaka Tsuruta, lead designer for Guzzler and Solomon's Key, under the supervision of Kazutoshi Ueda, the genius behind Mr. Do, Lady Bug and other Universal coin-ops.[CR]Curiously enough, the infamous Sphinx in the opening round was not rendered by the graphic designer of the game, but by Tsukasa Masuko, the sound designer. Tsuruta-san recalls how roles in Japanese development teams were quite interchangeable, in those early years.[CR]Round 1 music is the ending song from the Japanese animated cartoon series 'Spoon Oba-san', sung by the ultra-popular Mari Ijima (Lynn Minmay's voice in Macross). The anime was aired in 1983... at that time, Bomb Jack development was just starting : something more than a coincidence, then.[CR]Round 2 features the music of 'Lady Madonna', by The Beatles. Tsuruta-san,  recalls that rights were paid for the licensed music at the time; still, later ports (PS2 and Xbox) come with a replaced soundtrack (mostly the Vs. Mighty Bomb Jack score).[CR]"Bomb Jack II" has nothing really to do with Tekhan or Tecmo : it was developed by British Elite Systems for European home computers only, in an attempt to follow the huge success of the Bomb Jack coin-op conversion. They basically bought the license for the name, and then proceeded to create a mediocre maze game.[CR]Giauco Bondavalli holds the official record for this game with 20,010,960 points on November 3, 1984.[CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Tecmo Game Music - 28XA-95) on 25/09/1986.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The older version (set 2) says 'YOU ARE LUCY' instead of 'YOU ARE LUCKY'.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Jumping, hitting a wall or falling from a platform : 10 points x bonus multiplier value.[CR]Normal bomb : 100 points x bonus multiplier value.[CR]Firebomb : 200 points x bonus multiplier value.[CR](P) Power : 100 when blue, 200 when red, 300 when purple, 500 when green, 800 when cyan, 1,200 when yellow and 2,000 points when grey x bonus multiplier value.[CR](B) Bonus Multiplier: 1,000 points x bonus multiplier value.[CR](E) Extra Life : 1,000 points x bonus multiplier value plus an extra life.[CR](S) Special : 1,000 points x bonus multiplier value plus a free credit.[CR]Killing monsters while (P) is active : 100, 200, 300, 500, 800, 1,200 and 2,000 points. These are all multiplied by the current bonus multiplier value.[CR]End of level bonus :[CR]23 firebombs defused : 50,000 points.[CR]22 firebombs : 30,000 points.[CR]21 firebombs : 20,000 points.[CR]20 firebombs : 10,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* A little information about the appearance of the powerball : the rule is very simple and you just have to look at the colour at the left and right of the multiplicator number, its size grows as you collect bombs.[CR]1) Take a 'lit bomb' and you get 1 point ahead for the next Powerball. Take a non-lit bomb and you'll get 0.5 point for the next Powerball. When you achieve 10 points, the powerball appears. Your powerball points don't grow if either the powerball is there or if the 'power music' is playing, so avoid collecting bombs when it's not necessary.[CR]2) The powerball can have different score values when taking it. When it appears, jump or hit a wall and its colour will change. The colours and score values are blue (100 points), red (200 points), purple (300 points), green (500 points), turquoize (800 points), yellow (1000 points) and grey (2000 points).[CR]3) The 'B' bonus coin adds 1 to the multiplicator value and appears each 5,000 points, but only if you 'pass' these 5,000 points when not taking a 'B' coin. For example, your multiplicator is 2x, your score is 9,000 and you take a 'B' coin; giving you 1,000x2 = 2,000 points which makes a total of 11,000 points. A 'B' coin should then appear because you have passed the 10,000 points, but doesn't because you took a 'B' coin to achieve this score so you'll have to wait for 15,000 points to get a new 'B' coin. The multiplicator limit is X5.[CR]* An important piece of information to remember is that you can pick up the bombs in a certain order to earn maximum points. If you pick up most of the bombs while their fuses are lit, you get the following bonuses :[CR]20 - 10,000 pts.[CR]21 - 20,000 pts.[CR]22 - 30,000 pts.[CR]23 - 50,000 pts.[CR]So of course, you'll want to try to get 23 each time (This is of course, VERY difficult!). The P (Power) coin appears after every ninth bomb is collected. The points value of the P coin ranges from 100 (Blue) to 2,000 (Silver). Since the color changes each time BJ jumps, you can control the bonus level by making small jumps until the coin turns silver.[CR]* The B (Bonus) coin appears every 5,000 points, and advances the bonus multiplier by 1. There is a maximum of 5 B coins per level.[CR]* Picking up the S (Special) coin awards one free credit. It will also take you to the next level automatically.[CR]* You can control where the mechanical bird appears by holding the joystick in the opposite direction. Example : Hold the joystick to the Right as soon as the round starts and the mechanical bird appears on the left of the screen. If the stick is held diagonally, the bird appears in the opposite corner.[CR]* When you start a level, and directly go to left or right, bird(s) will appear on the other side : it's useful to put them where you want in order to make this level easier, levels 7, 8 &amp; 9 are good examples for that.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Kyokyoku !! PC Genjin - Special Arcade Version (c) 1994 Kaneko Company, Limited.[CR]A platform game, based on the NEC PC Engine game of the same name, consisting of 21 stages fighting dinosaurs and other creatures.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) OKI6295 (@ 12 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Head butt, [B] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]This game is known outside Japan as "Bonk's Adventure - Arcade Version" and in Europe as "B.C. Kid".[CR]This game had a ticket payout mechanism meaning you could also win cheesy prizes.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]* In the Korean version titlescreen, the 'KANEKO' standard logo is replaced by 'KA' with a cat (which is pronounced 'NEKO' in Japanese).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Bonk attacks enemies by "bonking" them with his large, invincible forehead. Bonk starts the game with three hearts' worth of health, which are depleted to blue as Bonk takes damage, and three extra lives. Bonk's health can be restored in increments by collecting fruits and vegetables.[CR]Bonk can also collect pieces of meat as power-ups; these lend him special abilities and make him stronger. There are three stages of power-up: his normal self, a second stage during which he can stun enemies by pounding on the ground, and a third stage where he becomes temporarily invulnerable. Meat can be found in two varieties: big meat and small meat. The effects of meat are additive but wear off over time. A small meat gives Bonk the second stage of meat power but will eventually decay into the first stage of meat power, and then back into regular Bonk. Eating a small meat while in stage two will put Bonk into the third, invincible stage of meat power. And eating either size of meat while in the third stage of meat power-up will reset the timer on Bonk's meat power.[CR]Bonk can occasionally collect red heart power-ups that refill an entire heart worth of health, or even more rarely, a large red heart, which restores all of Bonk's missing health. There are also two rare, blue heart power-ups in the game which will increase Bonk's maximum health by one heart.[CR]Bonking an enemy will typically knock it backward and slightly into the air. Defeating an enemy yields points and also releases a small "smiley" power-up. Bonk's smileys are totaled at the end of each stage after defeating the boss of that stage. The player is given additional points and a caveman type congratulation based on how many smileys were collected.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. PC Genjin [Model HC89024] (1989, PCE)[CR]2.

Graphically, the game is very similar to 'Bobble Bobble II', released a year earlier; the only real visual difference between the two is the latter game's use of some rather charmless digitized animal photographs that form the game's backdrops.[CR]One new gameplay addition, however, is the introduction of 'Super Bubbles'; There are now two sizes of bubble. Hold down the bubble button for about 1 second until you glow to produce a giant bubble. This giant bubble can trap either a single large enemy, or several smaller enemies. This replaces the 'Multiple Bubble' facility of the previous game in the series; 'Bubble Bobble II'.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "Taito F3 System" Hardware.[CR]Prom Stickers : E21[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]= &gt; [1] Bubble, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Even if title screen says 1995, Bubble Memories was released in February 1996.[CR]In the Taito logo sequence, a 'Zen-Chan' monster chases Bub from the right side of the screen to the left. When Bub reaches the left of the screen, he stops, turns around and traps Zen-Chan in a bubble. The bubble then pops, Zen-Chan is killed, and the Taito logo appears on screen.[CR]The entire cast of basic enemies from the original "Bubble Bobble" (including 'Skel', aka "Baron Von Blubba", so continue to watch out for him if you take too much time in a room; 'Rascal' also returns if you take too much time in a secret room) returns once again (however, the original game's end boss, 'Super Drunk' does not appear in this game), along with many of the characters first introduced in "Bubble Bobble II". There is also a new version of 'Monsta' with a teal body and yellow eyes, who moves horizontally and vertically, as opposed to the regular 'Monsta' who moves diagonally.[CR]Chack'n from "Chack'n Pop" joins Zen-Chan and company in the pursuit of Bub and Bob. In this game, he dons a blue helmet. There is also a large version of him requiring a giant bubble to trap and kill. There are also giant versions of Zen-Chan, PulPul, and Puka Puka.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Power Up Mode : Press Up, Right, Down, Left, Up, Right, Down, Left at the title screen.

				<plot>Bubble Bobble II (c) 1994 Taito.[CR]Bubble Bobble II, also known as Bubble Symphony, is the first direct sequel to Taito's 1986 platform classic, "Bubble Bobble" ('Rainbow Islands' was the first official sequel, but played very differently) in which one or two players take on the role of the infamous bubble-blowing dinosaurs who must once again fight their way through a large number of single-screen platform-based levels, trapping monsters with their bubbles before bursting them to destroy the trapped enemies. [CR]While the game plays identically to its predecessor, several new changes and additions have been made to breathe new life into the classic gameplay. As well as new bonuses, weapons, enemies and characters, players can now create 'Multiple Bubbles'; if the player holds the button down for a few seconds before releasing, up to three bubbles are produced at once. [CR]Other gameplay changes include Boss encounters that occur every five to ten levels. These boss screens are part of a new 'branching level' structure; once a boss is defeated, players chose to enter one of two doors to determine what level set they tackle next. [CR]In addition to the Bubble Bobble's original heroes, Bub and Bob, two new selectable female characters have been added, called Kululun and Cororon. Each of the four dinosaurs possess different gameplay attributes, which are as follows : [CR]* Bubblun - Average [CR]* Bobblun - Faster speed [CR]* Kululun - Bubbles float the furthest [CR]* Cororon - Bubbles float the fastest [CR]The game's graphics are, inevitably, a vast improvement over the original game; with lush, colourfully rendered backgrounds and detailed, smoothly animated sprites doing full justice to Bubble Bobble's legendary characters. The game also features cameo appearances by a number of characters from many other Taito classics. [CR]The game features multiple endings.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the "Taito F3 System" Hardware.[CR]Game ID : D90[CR]Players : 2 [CR]Control : 8-way joystick [CR]Buttons : 2 [CR]= &gt; [1] Bubble, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in October 1994 in Europe. [CR]This game is known in Japan and North America as "Bubble Symphony" (both names for the game have been used in Europe) and is unofficially Bubble Bobble 4, since three earlier arcade games featuring the same characters exist (more if the 'Puzzle Bobble' series is included). It could even be called 'Bubble Bobble V', since a cartridge for the NES/Famicom exists as 'Bubble Bobble 2' in Japan and as 'Bubble Bobble Part 2' in the US. [CR]In the attract mode title sequence, Bubblun appears in front of a closed red curtain (which will turn blue if the 'Game Mode Select' code is entered) announcing, 'Ladies and Gentlemen, this is... Bubble Bobble II!' The curtain then opens on the cast of enemies as follows : [CR]* Bottom row (left to right) : Flhoop, Uni Bo, Drunk, Banebou, Invader, Zen-Chan, Mighta, Rappappa, Catch Maru, Roboj, Hattonton [CR]* 2nd row from bottom (left to right) : Monsta, Komso, Kabukky, Mya-Ta, Heita-Kun, Warurin, Hidegonsu, No-No, Upper, Ame Da-Ma, PulPul [CR]* 2nd row from top (left to right) : Robol, Rocketl, Yuki-Bombo, Mummy, Chu-Chu Man, Jiji Poppo, Kiri Kabu Kun, Bolt Man, Strong Shell [CR]* Top row (left to right) : Dorabo, Ouji Sama, Knightron, Dranko, Magician, Denkyu-Kun, Ankororin [CR]* Not pictured : Puka Puka, Bake Couchin, Killer Hijia, Ti Ta Ma, Kasabe, Kon-Chan, Mimic, Skel-Monsta, Nyororin, Rascal, Yu Bo, Unicoron, Cerberorin, Kabu-Chan, YZK-Takami, Golem [CR]In the closing credits, PulPul's name is listed as 'Puru Puru'. [CR]The enemy known as 'Catch Maru' can be seen in two different color schemes : one with a blue robe and purple shoes (as seen in the attract mode title sequence), and one with a green robe and blue shoes. [CR]The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'H !'. [CR]There are a grand total of 164 rooms in the game, including 18 boss rooms.[CR]A prorotype version is known to exists: it have many differences from the final version, it&#8217;s almost an entirely different game, lacking even a title screen at the point in development it comes from. Levels, graphics, enemies, sound and music are different, gameplay is different, stage names are different, stage selection is different, no story sequence, no high score sequence, no game logo during attract, it&#8217;s really more of a proof of concept sequel than anything close to a finished game at this point and that's what makes it fascinating. The build date is close to a year before the final game, a lot changes in one year of development.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]In 'Super' mode, accessible after entering the 'Game mode select' code (see 'Tips and Tricks' below), enemies are switched around, as follows (Legend : 'Normal' mode monster --&gt; 'Super' mode monster) :[CR]Zen-Chan --&gt; Warurin (and vice-versa)[CR]Mighta --&gt; Dranko (and vice-versa)[CR]Monsta --&gt; Yu Bo[CR]PulPul --&gt; Strong Shell (and vice-versa)[CR]Banebou --&gt; Kasabe (and vice-versa)[CR]Hidegonsu --&gt; Hattonton[CR]Drunk --&gt; Chu-Chu Man[CR]Invader --&gt; Flhoop[CR]Flhoop --&gt; Bolt Man[CR]Yuki-Bombo --&gt; Drunk[CR]Mya-Ta --&gt; Yuki Bombo[CR]Chu-Chu Man --&gt; Hidegonsu[CR]Magician --&gt; Knightron (and vice-versa)[CR]Komso --&gt; Cerberorin (and vice-versa)[CR]Catch Maru (in blue robe and purple shoes) --&gt; No-No[CR]Catch Maru (in green robe and blue shoes) --&gt; Kabu-Chan[CR]Mummy --&gt; Unicoron[CR]Puka Puka --&gt; Bake Couchin[CR]Ame Da-Ma --&gt; Nyororin[CR]Upper --&gt; Kiri Kabu Kun (and vice-versa)[CR]Bake Couchin --&gt; Ame Da-Ma[CR]Hattonton --&gt; Roboj[CR]Ti Ta Ma --&gt; Robol (and vice-versa) [CR]Heita-Kun --&gt; Jiji Poppo[CR]Kabukky --&gt; Uni Bo (and vice-versa)[CR]Nyororin --&gt; Puka Puka[CR]Ouji Sama --&gt; Mummy[CR]Yu Bo --&gt; Golem[CR]Rappappa --&gt; Ouji Sama[CR]Golem --&gt; Monsta[CR]Roboj --&gt; Mya-Ta[CR]Unicoron --&gt; Rappappa[CR]Kabu-Chan --&gt; Heita-Kun[CR]Bolt Man --&gt; Invader[CR]Jiji Poppo --&gt; Catch Maru (in blue robe and purple shoes)[CR]No-No --&gt; Catch Maru (in green robe and blue shoes)[CR]Monsters not listed remain the same.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Always Access Secret Rooms : Before inserting your coin, at the intro screen with the curtain, press Jump, Bubble, Jump, Bubble, Jump, Bubble, Left, Start.

				<plot>Bubble Bobble (c) 1986 Taito Corp.[CR]One or two players take on the role of Bub and Bob, two cute dinosaurs who must battle through 100 platform-packed single screen levels to rescue their girlfriends. Bub and Bob are armed only with the ability to blow bubbles, in which the game's many enemies can be trapped and killed. The bubbles can also be used as temporary platforms, to help the dinosaurs reach previously inaccessible areas of a level. [CR]Any trapped enemies who are not killed quickly enough will turn red and escape their bubble prison. These angry enemies are much faster than before, making them harder to kill. Enemies also become angry if players are taking too long to complete a level. Defeated enemies are turned into bonus fruit items that can be collected for points. [CR]On many levels, bubbles containing fire, water or a lightning bolt appear. These can be burst by players to release their contents and destroy enemies. The fire bubble drops flames down onto the nearest platform, killing any enemies it hits. The lightning bubble sends a lightning bolt horizontally across the screen, its direction dictated by whichever side of the bubble the player hits to burst it. The water bubble releases a torrent of water that will quickly flow down the platforms to the bottom of the screen. Any enemies caught in the flow are killed. [CR]Bubbles containing letters also appear. The aim is to collect the letters needed to speel the word E.X.T.E.N.D. which earns players an extra life. [CR]The game's simple-yet-involving game-play saw Bubble Bobble become an instant classic. Its two-player co-operative mode, coupled with the incredible amount of hidden secrets and potential for strategic play - unheard of in the platform genre - would set the standard by which all other platform games were judged.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : (2x) Zilog Z80 (@ 6 Mhz), Zilog Z80 (@ 3 Mhz), M6801 (@ 1 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM2203 (@ 3 Mhz), YM3526 (@ 3 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 2-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [1] Bubble, [2] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Bubble Bobble was released in August 1986. [CR]This was one of the first games to feature multiple endings. [CR]The title of this game, Bubble Bobble, is a cross between the words 'bubble' and the name of the heroes : Bub and Bob. [CR]The enemies are named (Round number of initial appearance applies to 'Normal' mode. For information on 'Super' mode, please see the Romstar (US version) entry, Updates section : [CR]'Zen-Chan' [aka 'Bubble Buster', 'Benzo'] - First appears in Round 1 [CR]'Mighta' [aka 'Stoner', 'Boris'] - First appears in Round 6 [CR]'Monsta' [aka 'Beluga', 'Blubba'] - First appears in Round 10 [CR]'PulPul' [aka 'Hullaballoon', 'Boaboa'] - First appears in Round 20 [CR]'Banebou' [aka 'Coiley', 'Bonnie-bo'] - First appears in Round 30 [CR]'Hidegonsu' [aka 'Incendo'] - First appears in round 40 [CR]'Drunk' [aka 'Willy Whistle', 'Bonner'] - First appears in Round 50 [CR]'Invader' [aka 'Super Socket'] - First appears in Round 60 [CR]'Super Drunk' [aka 'Grumple Gromit'] - the boss character whom Bub and Bob fight in the final round [CR]'Skel-Monsta' [aka 'Baron Von Blubba'] - Appears when you take too much time in a round [CR]'Rascal' [aka 'Rubblen'] - Appears when you linger too long in a secret room [CR]The data code contains unused graphics of a full set of slot machine icons. These aren't used anywhere, there's no palette that fits them, and they wouldn't really fit anywhere either. [CR]In 1996, Taito announced that they lost the original source code program to Bubble Bobble following a reorganization - when it came to the recent ports and sequels, they had to work from program disassembly, playing the game and (mainly) the various home computer ports. [CR]The game forbids the initials 'SEX' on the high score table. If you try, it gets changed to 'H.!', but go to the Tips and Tricks section for more information about 'SEX' :-) [CR]Olly Cotton holds the official record for this game with 6,060,730 points on February 23, 2011. [CR]Some bootlegs of this game are known as "Bobble Bobble" and "Super Bobble Bobble". [CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Taito Game Music - 28XA-110) on January 25, 1987. [CR]NES cover band The Advantage cover two songs from Bubble Bobble on their self-titled debut album released on April 6, 2004.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Bursting a bubble : 10 points. [CR]Killing one monster : 1,000 points. [CR]Killing two monsters at once : 2,000 points. [CR]Killing three monsters at once : 4,000 points. [CR]Points double for each extra monster killed at any one time. [CR]Normal Fruit : 700 points. [CR]Bonus Score Items (popcorn, burger etc) : 500 - 4,000 points.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Bubble Bobble is a game heavily relying on game-play and precise technique rather than graphics, and it features a series of special techniques and tricks a player can perform to maximize his or her score, make some rounds of the game easier or faster to finish or just to be able to survive or even finish a round. Some of these techniques have special nicknames, which may differ from player to player and from country to country. [CR]'Kissing monsters' or just kissing means killing a monster by blowing a bubble at almost contact distance : the monster will be instantly bubbled and the bubble will be instantly popped, giving the visual effect of the player killing a monster with a 'kiss'. Some players flip their joysticks in the opposite direction after pressing the bubble buttons, giving more chances of an 'instant pop' and changing flight direction for the dead monster. This technique is useful in stages where monsters move too fast, bubbles last for too short of a time or it's otherwise hard to bubble them normally. Of course good timing is required for this technique to work. [CR]'Riding bubbles' means keeping the jump button pressed when dropping on a bubble: if done correctly, instead of popping the bubble, your dragon will instead jump on it, possibly continuously, enabling him to 'ride' bubbles in order to reach otherwise unreachable areas. Some stages can't be finished without this technique. [CR]'Climbing' is a step up from riding bubbles. It means standing at half a bubble distance from a wall, jumping and blowing a bubble almost simultaneously, jumping up from that bubble and blowing another bubble and so on. This is necessary if the air current pushes down bubbles but you need to climb up. Having the rapid-bubbling power-up (the yellow candy) makes climbing a lot easier, especially if you got the running shoes already. [CR]'Bubbling oneself through' means 'riding a bubble' through the opening at the top of a stage or even just through the ceiling of a stage in order to appear at the lower part, like some flying monsters can do. This technique is required to finish some stages or to get unstuck from some places, or just to save time. [CR]'Blowing against the wall' means blowing bubbles against wall at contact distance : the bubbles will pop immediately thus giving the player 10 points per bubble pop. This can be used to either increase a player's score, or to set a player's score to a specific amount, in order to do other tricks. [CR]'Two equal digits' means using the 'blowing against the wall' technique or other score-adjusting techniques in order to make the two penultimate (100s and 10s places) digits of at least one player equal, e.g., 456770, before the last enemy bubble is burst. If done correctly and the score is not modified when this occurs, then all remaining non-special bubbles on screen will be turned to 700-point bonuses, whose appearance depends on the digit picked. E.g., 7 gives Chocolate Ice Creams, 3 gives Hamburgers, and so on. [CR]Note : This trick is easier to do with two players (one player adjusts his score and the other bursts the bubbles), but it can also be done with only one player, although calculating exactly how much (and if) one's score will be modified when bursting the last enemy bubbles can be extremely complex, if not unpredictable, especially if there are very large and clustered bubble bunches. [CR]Note : Rounds with numbers ending with 5 and 0 up to and including level 50 generate bonuses from bubbles automatically, though, and some rounds (including round 1) do it by default. [CR]Internal Counters : An interesting (and exploitable) part of bubble bobble is that powerups are not entirely random. As with the two-digit trick, many internal counters in this game decide which special powers are available for collection. For example, rapid bubble shooting (a sweet in yellow wrapping), fast moving bubbles (a blue sweet), or fast moving bubbles (a blue sweet) appear shortly after either Bub or Bob jumps 51 times, pops 51 bubbles, or blows 51 bubbles. Also, running around a lot causes the speed powerup (red shoe) to appear. Keeping this is mind, it is possible to gain all power-ups with relative ease. Although there are many more counters that control various aspects of the game, one of particular interest is the letters forming the word EXTEND. Getting all 7 letters will end the current level and award the player with an extra life 'NICE 1P!' - these letters have a greater chance of appearing when more enemies are defeated simultaneously. Also, gathering three of the same letter causes candy canes to appear which in turn lead to a special big item at the end of the level! [CR]* Unlimited Run And Rapid Fire : At the main title screen, press Left, Jump, Left, 1P, Left, Fire, Left, 1P. If this is done correctly there will be a message in the bottom left corner of the title screen a red POWER UP!. [CR]* Original Bubble Bobble : At the title screen, press Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Shoot, Jump, Right, 1P. It will say at the bottom of screen ORIGINAL GAME. The game will give the PORTALS in some screens, if you can get in them you will get LOADS of diamonds. [CR]* The 'Super Bubble Bobble' Code : this will change the Bubble Bobble logo in 'Super Bubble Bobble' and the game will change under several points of view : different platform colors, different order for monster appearances... The code that must be entered at the title screen to access Super Bubble Bobble is displayed at the end of the credits after you beat the game in 2 players, normal mode. The message is coded, but it hints you to enter the secret room in level 20 to get the key for decoding. If you do so, you enter the secret room, on the base of which there is an inscription. The first line is the coding of the alphabet, the other lines are coded advices to beat the final boss. The decoded 'secret message' is : SJBLRJSR (Start - Jump - Bubble - Left - Right - Jump - Start - Right) [CR]The decoded advices in the secret rooms are : [CR]Room in level 20 : IF YOU WANT TO BECOME THE OLD FIGURE, USE THE POWER OF YOUR FRIENDSHIP, AND FIGHT WITH ME! (hint to play in two player mode to defeat the final boss and see the real ending) [CR]Room in level 30 : I ENCLOSE THESE MAGICAL MEDICINE HERE, BECAUSE THOSE ARE MY WORST FEARS... (hint to use the lighting bubble to beat the boss) [CR]Room in level 40 : IF YOU WANT TO GET BACK YOUR LOVE OF TRUTH, YOU MUST HELP EACH OTHER UNTILL THE LAST... (hint to end the game in two player mode to see the real endings) [CR]A little more trivia on Super Bubble Bobble : If you beat the game in Super mode, two players, you will discover that the final boss is your mother and father that were controlled by some unknown evil. By defeating the boss you free them and your girlfriends, and are reverted back to your original human form (the one you play "Rainbow Island" with). [CR]* Secret Tombs : Make it to level 20 without dying and a door appears -- it leads to a 'secret tomb', a level full of diamonds. There are secret tombs at levels 20 and 30, also. Make it to level 50 without dying and a strange, bee-hive-shaped door appears; enter it and you warp to level 70. DON'T kill the Drunks on level 50, or the door disappears; bubble them and wait! Btw, with two players, only one of the players must survive unharmed to get the secret door. [CR]* Paffing A Skel : Skel, also known as 'Baron Von Blubba', is that nasty white monster that comes after you when you've taken too long; with two players, two Skels will appear. If one player is killed by HIS Skel, then he can collide with his partner's Skel 'WHILE HE IS STILL FLICKERING'. If the player's icon is still flickering, the other player's Skel will disappear (poof!), with no harm to the once-slain character. [CR]* Full Ending Sequence : Beat the game with two players in Super mode and you'll get the full end sequence. [CR]* High Score Codes : after getting a high score, enter your initials as : [CR]'SEX' - Pitch fork-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds. [CR]'TAK' - Octopus-turns bubbles into X's at end of level. [CR]'STR' - Flamingo-turns bubbles into smiling turds at end of level. [CR]'KTT' - Beer-turns bubbles into pizzas at end of level, what a perfect match !!! [CR]'...' - Knife-flying cakes/vegetables/etc across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds. [CR]'I.F', 'MTJ', 'NSO', 'KIM', 'YSH' - Coke can-flying sunflowers across the screen, turn enemies into 6k diamonds.

				<plot>Cadash (c) 1989 Taito Corp.[CR]Four great heroes: a fighter, a wizard, a cleric and a ninja go on a quest to rescue the captured princess. This Taito adventure game feature all the ingredients of a traditional role-playing game (stats, exp, buy upgrade in store...).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Prom Stickers : C21[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz), Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Even if titlescreen says 1989, Cadash was released in March 1990 in Japan.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Cameltry, Cadash - PCCB-00043) on October 21, 1990.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version has the 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen.[CR]The Japanese and US versions are harder. Here are the main differences from the other revisions:[CR]* Medical herbs cost 200 gold each instead of 20.[CR]* Each character can carry only 4 herbs instead of 8. This also applies to antidotes.[CR]* Some of the priestess' magic are toned down. The shield spell can take less hits before disappearing, and the time spell gives 30 seconds instead of 60.[CR]* Inns get more expensive after a few uses. Their progressive price is 50, 200, 1,000, 6,000, 30,000 and 60,000 instead of 50, 200, 1,000, 2,000 and 5,000.[CR]* The Amulet of Dragon gives 10,000 gold instead of 60,000.[CR]There are many spelling and syntax errors in the French version texts.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Characters list:[CR]- Fighter: Best offensive and defensive power. Cannot use magic. [CR]- Mage: Weak physical strength but strong attack magic. [CR]- Priest: Uses defensive magic and has great endurance, but has weak offensive powers. [CR]- Ninja: Uses thrown weapons and has excellent agility. Cannot use magic. [CR]* Debug Mode (in Debug Mode, you will be able to select starting scene, gold, EXP and several items) :[CR]1) Hold Service Switch and reset the game.[CR]2) Wait until 'Service Switch Error Message' is displayed, then push 'Start(x3), Service, Start'.[CR]3) The game boots up then insert a credit and select a character.[CR]4) Enter Debug Mode instead of starting the game.[CR]* Your character jumps backwards when hit by an enemy. When you're trying to quickly cross some areas where you're likely to take damage, this can be a bad thing; it can cause you to stay in the dangerous area much longer. So, to reduce the damage, turn back just before you get hit. This will cause the impact to push you -forward-, getting you out of danger more quickly.[CR]* The maximum amount of money you can have is 60,000 Golds.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Produced by : Keisuke Hasegawa[CR]Directed by : Onijust[CR]Director of Software : Toru Sugawara (SGW)[CR]Main Programmer : Tarabar Hori (TAK)[CR]Monster Programmer: Yuichi Kohyama[CR]Trap Programer : Masaki Yagi (YMOT) (MYG)[CR]Scenario Programmer : Seiichi Taikoishi[CR]Production Designer : Onijust (ONJ)[CR]Graphic Designers : Onijust (ONJ), Takatsuna Senba, Hisakazu Katoh, Kozo Igarashi, Yoshihiro Iwata, Tetsuya Shinoda, Takayuki Ogawa, Kenichi Imaeda[CR]Assistant Graphic Design : Visual Arts Production[CR]Supervising Editor : Masaki Yagi (YMOT)[CR]Map Editor : Onijust[CR]Hardware Engineer : Tadashi Kushiro[CR]Electrician : Tomio Takeda[CR]Sound Producer : Pochi (Zuntata)[CR]Music Composer : Pinch Punch[CR]Sound Effects : Pinch Punch[CR]Mechanician : Yasunori Hatsuta[CR]Publicity Supervisor : Kazuo Nakagawa[CR]Software Analyzers : Hidehiro Fujiwara, Yuji Hiroshige[CR]Data Entry : Mari Iwano[CR]Game Designer : Onijust[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]NEC PC-Engine [JP] (January 18, 1991) "Cadash [Model TP02015]"[CR]NES TurboGrafx-16 [US] (1991) "Cadash [Model WTG040501]" [CR]Sega Genesis [US] (1992) "Cadash [Model T-11086]" [CR]Sega Mega Drive [KO] (1992) "Cadash" by Samsung [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [JP] (August 25, 2005) "Taito Memories Gekan [Model SLPM-66092]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [EU] (March 31, 2006) "Taito Legends 2" [CR]* Computers : [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [EU] (March 31, 2006) "Taito Legends 2" [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [US] (July 10, 2007) "Taito Legends 2" [CR]* Others :[CR]Nokia N-Gage [US] "Taito Memories" : release cancelled[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Dyna Gear - An Action Adventure On The Era Of Dinosaur (c) 1993 Sammy.[CR]Dyna Gear is a scrolling platform run 'n' gun game for one or two players in which two starships from the year 2993 AD fall through a time-hole and end up 65 million years in the past, above a prehistoric Earth-like planet. One ship is piloted by hero and 'time patroller', Roger, while the other is piloted by the evil Gustaf. The two ships shoot each down and crash-land onto the planet below, where Roger discovers that Gustaf has transformed many of the planet's dinosaurs into aggressive 'combat dinosaurs'. [CR]Players take control of either the muscular hero, Roger, or of Wolf; a bipedal wolfman who wants to free his prehistoric homeworld from Gustaf's clutches. They must battle through several dinosaur-infested stages in their quest to end Gustaf's plans. [CR]Different weapons and health boosts can be found in the destructible wooden chests that litter the stages, enemies also drop coins when killed that can be collected for bonus points. [CR]Each of the two heroes also has a 'double-jump' move; players can jump, then jump again while still in the air. This allows them to reach previously inaccessible ledges and platforms as well as occasionally take different routes through a stage. In the single-player game, a wolfman will occasionally join with the player to aid in the fight. A large, powerful 'boss' dinosaur guards the end of each stage and must be defeated to progress.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : V60[CR]Sound Chips : ES5506[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; Throw Weapons, Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Developed by Sekarabe.[CR]Released in March 1994 (even if title screen says 1993).[CR]The background used for the title screen is the Area 4 background.[CR]There are background characters from "Survival Arts" scattered throughout the game :[CR]* In the cliff near the end of Stage 3, strike the wall in the cavity until a monk pops up.[CR]* Other monks rise up from the lava pits in the final stage.[CR]* During the final boss, there is a female monk in the background.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Game Design : Hideo Akimoto, Mitsuo Yoshioka[CR]Program : Mitsuo Yoshioka[CR]Character Design : Kaoru Kamigiku[CR]Object Character : Kaoru Kamigiku, Hideo Akimoto, Motoki Oashi, Hiroyuki Suwahara, Nobuhiko Ikeuchi, Airi Tateishi[CR]Background Character : Hisaya Yamazaki, Noriko Fuzisawa, Motoki Oashi[CR]Sound &amp; Effect : Shigeyuki Shinbo[CR]Translation : David Kanda[CR]Special Thanks : Minoru Tomizawa, Chacky, Toshiya Saito, Takayuki Sasaki, Yoshio Nagashima[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (c) 1985 Atari Games Corp.[CR]The player takes on the role of action movie hero, Indiana Jones, in a game that takes place over 3 different zones; the mines, a minecart chase and the temple. The first level features a number of platforms, ladders and slides and Indy must free kidnapped children by finding their cages and whipping them open.[CR]The player must also keep an eye out for rattlesnakes and Thuggee guards. The second zone is a recreation of the infamous minecart chase in the movie and the player must guide Indy's cart to the bottom of the mine; keeping ahead of enemy carts and voiding traps and track-side enemies. The final area takes place in the temple itself and Indy must make his way to the altar and retrieve the Sankara stone. Indy must avoid guards and also flaming hearts thrown by the game's enemy boss, Mola Ram.[CR]The player can choose to start the game on any one of 3 difficulty levels : easy, medium and hard. These are selected at the beginning of the game by entering the corresponding door. Once all 3 Sankara stones have been collected, Indy must work his way through a final mine and minecart section, before making his escape on the rope bridge and facing Mola Ram once and for all. Playing the easy level will not include this level the first time Indy acquires all three stones. Instead, a message will appear stating that Indy escaped on the rope bridge. The player is then returned to the game, starting again on a more difficult mines level.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 136036[CR]Runs on the "Atari System 1" hardware.[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom was released in August 1985.[CR]1139 dedicated units were produced in the USA.

				<title_clean>Platformers - Karnov</title_clean>
				<plot>Karnov (c) 1987 Data East.[CR]Karnov is a 2-D, platform style game. You control Karnov through 9 scenes. Each of these scenes gives you piece of a map (except the first scene). Get all the pieces of the map and you get to the treasure. Your journey won't be easy though. You will be going through some rough environment such as towns, forests, oceans, and caves. To further make your travels a hazard, different enemies attempt to end Karnov's life prematurely and prevent him from getting to the treasure. To aid Karnov in his adventures, he has certain items that he can draw from his inventory. In addition, there are other items that can make Karnov a potent foe of those wishing to harm him. You must complete each scene in order to advance to the next scene. All in a days work of a hearty explorer.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 1.5 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM2203 (@ 1.5 Mhz), YM3526 (@ 3 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (JUMP, SELECT)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Karnov was released in January 1987.[CR]The main character became the famous Data East icon and appeared in many other games of the manufacturer.[CR]Karnov's full name is 'Jinborov Karnovski'.[CR]Alfa Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Data East Game Music - 28XA-205) on May 10, 1988.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version has :[CR]* More enemies.[CR]* The ostrich in level 1.[CR]* The red serpents.[CR]* This version hurries you along if you dawdle by dropping invincible plants that fire at you and red serpents when you put up your ladder - this doesn't happen in the Japanese version.[CR]* When you use Boomerang or Flame, after it is used up you return to your original triple fire (in Japanese version, you go back to base single fire).[CR]* Some of the placements are different for the random items.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is relatively hard since there are a lot of things you can get points for.

Some of the scenes will reuse these bosses again. Sometimes you will even get more then one of the same kind of boss to tangle with either at the end of a scene or somewhere within the scene (this is especially true in the later scenes). Listed below are the bosses and a couple of tactics that you can use to defeat them. It is best to have your full firepower to tangle with these bosses instead of just using your pathetic one shot.[CR]MERMAN : His mode of attack is to throw water balls at you and jump around. He is one of the easier bosses to deal with.[CR]1) When he enters the screen, start firing on him. If your shot power is enhanced, you may be able to take him out before he has a chance to attack.[CR]2) If you don't take him out when he enters, be prepared to jump because he will throw a water ball at your character.[CR]3) Continue to jump back and forth. Fire on him when you land and you should take care of him quickly.[CR]TRAINER AND LIONS : This boss comes on the screen as a man holding two lions on a leash. The lions[CR]spit fire in addition to a claw attack.[CR]1) The first thing you don't want to do is take out the trainer first. If you do, the two lions will immediately attack.[CR]2) Go to the left side, duck, and start hacking away at the lions. It will take several shots to take one of the lions down.[CR]3) When the trainer and lions get about three-quarters of the way across the screen, jump over them and repeat the above from the right side.[CR]4) Once the lions are taken care of, take out the trainer. Again, watch out for the fireballs.[CR]SCORPION WOMAN : She's big and she's bad. She will usually come crawling down a wall to do battle with Karnov. She likes to spit a massive barrage of fire at Karnov.[CR]1) You must hit the Scorpion Woman in her torso, hitting her body won't hurt her.[CR]2) Every time you score a hit, she will rear up and let loose with a barrage of fire.[CR]3) Jump around the screen and jump over her to avoid her fire. Make sure that when you jump, she isn't reared up or you will be killed.[CR]4) She tends to lay a pattern of fire from top to bottom. Remember this when you are jumping so you don't jump into her line of fire.[CR]5) Continue to jump around her and fire and you should have this bug squashed in no time.[CR]TYRANNOSAURUS REX : This big old dinosaur is not only very large, it also has a very nasty breath[CR]weapon. Because he is so tall, it makes it even more of a challenge to hit his head (which you must do to kill him).[CR]1) When the Tyrannosaurus Rex (T-Rex) first enters the area, jump straight up and sent a heavy volume of fire his way. He will flash when hits are scored.[CR]2) The T-Rex is pretty quick so don't get yourself caught in a corner. The T-Rex will either barbeque or just stomp on Karnov. Jumping around is the key to avoid this problem.[CR]3) Try to jump to the far sides (left or right) so that you can get at least a couple of shots off when you jump vertically. The T-Rex will usually almost be on Karnov after the second volley.[CR]4) Continue to maneuver around and you will have dinosaur steaks for dinner.[CR]TWO-HEADED DRAGON : Besides the wizard, this is one of the most brutal bosses. His breath weapon is very nasty and so is his bite. The breath weapon can get Karnov in two ways. The first way is a direct hit. The other way is when it explodes against some object. Fragments will explode outwards and could hit Karnov.[CR]1) This will require you to do some very fancy maneuvering. The dragon is slow but it more then makes up for that in offensive capabilities.[CR]2) When the dragon fires on Karnov, watch where the shot fragments go. You must hit the heads to kill this dragon off. The best way might be to find a ledge to take shots at it.[CR]3) You will only have time for one shot before you have to move since the dragon's firepower covers such a broad area.[CR]4) Again, jump around and make your shots count. Eventually you will add some dragon heads to your collection.[CR]WIZARD : You will only encounter this boss once since he is the final boss. He has a nasty offensive spell and a couple of good defensive moves. The bad part of this boss is that when you enter his area, you lose all your inventory items and power-ups.[CR]1) Right before you enter the Wizard's area, equip the Jump/Running Shoes and Boomerang. Then enter his area.[CR]2) You will see three ledges (one high and two low). The Wizard maneuvers around these ledges and fires out a ring of stars. These can be tricky to avoid but it can be done.[CR]3) Instead, when the Wizard appears on one of the two lower ledges, fire the boomerang at him. Depending on whether the machine is set to easy or hard will determine whether the boomerang kills him or not. If it doesn't, a few more shots should finish him off.[CR]4) If you don't have the boomerang, be prepared for a very long fight. You must concentrate on avoiding his fire while getting shots in on him. This means constantly moving around.[CR]5) It will take a lot of shots to bring him down and end his magical days.[CR]* Below are some basic strategies for getting through the game...[CR]1) You will have 200 seconds to get through each scene. This means you must plan for good time management in order to have enough time to deal with the scene bosses.[CR]2) Remember, you can move in eight directions on the screen. Use this to your advantage to avoid an enemy's fire while taking them down at the same time.[CR]3) There are a lot of items that are hidden from your view (either because they are too high or because they are truly hidden). Use the Ladder and Mask at all times to get the most amount of items you can.[CR]4) Some areas have alternate routes. This means you will have to decide beforehand since you won't be able to backtrack to go on another path.[CR]5) The game scrolls along with the character which means that once you have passed an area, you cannot return to it again.[CR]6) Try to jump instead of walk. The reason is that sometimes items fall from the sky or ceiling making it that much easier to collect them.[CR]7) If you take too long in a part of the scene, indestructible seeds will fall from the top of the screen. Once they hit the ground, they become indestructible flowers that shoot fire. To avoid this, move through each scene quickly.[CR]* SCENE 1 : This is  one of the easier levels to introduce you to the game.[CR]1) You start off on a platformed area. Immediately collect the Ladder and move to the right.[CR]2) Green-Hooded Creatures will attack Karnov. Once disposed of, use the Ladder to collect the Bomb.[CR]3) You will then encounter a Gray Rock Golem atop a rock. The Gray Rock Golem will throw a rock every two seconds. You can destroy the rock but you get no points. Once you take out the golem, jump on the area he was and use the Ladder to retrieve the Super Fireball and Jump/Running Shoes (you can get the shoes by jumping in the same area since they will fall to the ground).[CR]4) Some more Green-Hooded Creatures will attack.[CR]5) You will see a Gargoyle in a tree. Behind it will be a Orange Sphere. Take out the Gargoyle and retrieve the sphere.[CR]6) Ostrich Riders will attack. After you dispose of them, use the Ladder to retrieve the three K's midway on the first building.[CR]7) Before the stairs, you will have to tangle with a Brown Rock Golem. The Brown Rock Golem will throw rocks any time you hit it. Again, rocks get you no points.[CR]8) When you get to the stairs, you will be assaulted by Large Flying Demons and a couple of Ostrich Riders.[CR]9) Knights will attack when you get to the top of the steps. After you dispose of them, use your Ladder to get two Bombs.[CR]10) About three-quarters of the way across the bridge you will be attacked by Small Flying Demons.[CR]11) Another Gray Rock Golem awaits you on the bridge. Behind it will be a Brown Rock Golem.[CR]12) After you go down the stairs, you will be attacked by a Gargoyle, Small Flying Demons, and Knights.

There are a few treasures for the taking. The enemies aren't as bad as in scene 6 but there are still a lot of them.[CR]1) You first will be attacked by a group of Greek Fighters along with Eagles.[CR]2) You next will need to navigate through the Large Statues. There are a total of five to navigate through.[CR]3) Next you will need to climb the pyramid. When you get to the first level with a doorway, use a bomb to blow the door open.[CR]4) Go in and you will be attacked by more Greek Fighters. Go up the incline and prepare for a boss.[CR]5) This battle involves the TWO-HEADED DRAGON.[CR]6) After clearing out the dragon, continue to the right and jump the gap. Climb up to the top platform.

Finish him off and head up the steps.[CR]10) Be very careful on this part, there are boulder traps for each step so either jump back or destroy them with firepower.[CR]11) Collect the fourteen K's and finish climbing. At the top of the steps, bats will attack.[CR]12) After that, another boss battle with another TWO-HEADED DRAGON will finish the scene.[CR]* SCENE 8 : Another scene where things will be tough.

Collect the four K's.[CR]5) Large Flying Demons and more Tree Spirits will attack. After that, Small Flying Demons will get in their licks.  Collect the four K's.[CR]6) The boss battle will be another TYRANNOSAURUS REX to finish off the scene.[CR]* SCENE 9 : This is the last scene to be completed. This area is very tough and you will be hard pressed in the time department to finish it. Don't get involved in all the little battles. Get to the Wizard as quickly as possible.[CR]1) Use your Ladder to collect the two Bombs, Run/Jump Shoes, Super Fireball, Mask, and a Ladder.[CR]2) You will then be attacked by Knights and Large Flying Demons until you get to the platform areas. Then Bats will make a brief appearance.[CR]3) When you get to the platforms, don't go up. Instead, jump the chasm to the right. You will be attacked by a Boss MERMAN. Although space is tight, you should take him out.[CR]4) You will also notice that Small Earth Elementals are spilling over the ledges. This is the desired effect so you don't have to deal with them up top.[CR]5) Now, go back to the right and climb the platforms. At the top of the second platform, Small Flying Demons may attack.[CR]6) Go to the right to the next ledge. Use heavy firepower to hit the large mounds of dirt. These will change into Large Earth Elementals. There are three of them.[CR]7) Keep going right. At the end of the ledge, jump to the right. You will land on another ledge.  If you just drop, you will land in a pit with a lot of mummies.[CR]8) Take care of the two mummies from the ledge and look to the right. You will see two SCORPION WOMAN. Don't worry about them right now, just avoid their fire.[CR]9) Climb up the two sets of ladders and head right.  At the end of the ledge, drop off. You will see a wall to the right. Fire on it and the wall opens up. Before going in, power yourself up.[CR]10) Enter this area for the last boss fight with the WIZARD.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Nintendo Famicom [JP] (December 18, 1987)[CR]Nintendo NES [US] (January 1988) "Karnov [Model NES-KV-USA]" [CR]* Computers : [CR]PC [Booter] [US] (1987)[CR]Amstrad CPC [EU] (1988)[CR]Sinclair ZX Spectrum [EU] (1988)[CR]Commodore C64 [US] [EU] (1988)[CR]* Others : [CR]LCD handheld game [US] (1989) released by Tiger Electronics : features 9 levels.[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Magician Lord (c) 1990 Alpha Denshi Company, Limited.[CR]Magician Lord is a side-scrolling platform shoot-em-up in which players take on the roll of a wizard called Elta - the last Magician Lord - on his quest to save his homeland from the evil Gul-Agieze, who plans to resurrect the God of Destruction using 8 tomes of mystical power.[CR]Elta has to jump, shoot and climb his way to the end of each of the game's 8 levels where he must beat a servant of Gal, along with one of Gal's sinister boss creations. To complete the game Elta must reach the final stage and defeat Az Atorse himself. If the player takes too long to complete a stage, Elta will be harassed by an invincible monster.[CR]Elta's primary form of attack is a weak but fast-moving energy projectile that can fired in one of four directions, but by collecting the special coloured orbs that ocassionally appear, he can transform into a different form, making him more powerful and giving him new attacks.[CR]These are the six different forms that Elta can assume by picking up the colored orbs:[CR]* Dragon Warrior: In this form Elta attacks by breathing fire; a continuous short-range attack that, unlike the standad attack, can also be aimed diagonally.[CR]* Waterman: The Waterman-form attacks with water grenades &#8211; blue bubbles of water that burst upon touching the ground and form into water pillars. The attack can hit several times for additional damage but only covers a small area.[CR]* Poseidon: A more powerful version of the Waterman, Poseidon shoots wide waves of water that travel along the ground for several hits. It does severe damage and causes enemies to freeze and shatter on impact. While very powerful, this form moves very slowly.[CR]* Shinobi: The Shinobi-form gains increased agility and attacks with powerful magical arcs of fire which are wide but slow-moving.[CR]* Samurai: While limited in range, the Samurai-form is the only form that can attack through walls, shields or even multiple enemies, using a boomerang-like energy attack that does heavy damage.[CR]* Raijin: The Raijin-form gives Elta's jumping ability a big boost as well as a unique attack that creates a continuous electrical field around his body.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-005[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Shot, [B] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Magician Lord was released on April 26, 1990.

				<plot>Mystic Warriors - Ikari no Ninja (c) 1993 Konami.[CR]Mystic Warriors is a horizontally-scrolling platform beat-em-up for up to four players, in which the evil 'SKULL' organisation has taken over the world and driven its terrified civilians into hiding. Five Ninja warriors set about destroying SKULL and freeing the World from its grip.[CR]Mystic Warriors features five selectable characters, one of which is shown being kidnapped by SKULL once players have made their character choices. What follows is eight levels of platform 'run-and-gun' action, with an end-of-level boss waiting at the end of each stage.[CR]Players are armed with both Shuriken throwing stars and with a sword for close encounters. Numerous boxes are scattered throughout the levels (or are being carried by enemies), all of which contain bonus items such as weapon power-ups or energy-replenishing food. Other power-ups include an invulnerability shield (known as the "Shinobi Shield") which lasts a few seconds and a "Smart Bomb" power-up, which destroys all on-screen enemies. Some boxes also contain points-giving items, such as bags of money, jewellery and gold.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX128[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 16 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) K054539 (@ 48 Khz)[CR]Players: 2 or 4 (selectable by Dipswitch)[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; Shuriken/Sword, Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Mystic Warriors was released in February 1993.[CR]The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Wrath of Ninja'.[CR]The attract mode intro from "Sunset Riders" plays on the large theatre screen at the end of Stage 1.[CR]King Records released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Konami Amusement Sounds '93 - Summer) on 08/1993.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version is slightly different, it has the "Winners Don't Use Drugs" screen.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Designer: Hideyuki Tsujimoto[CR]</plot>

As long as you do not get hit, the diamonds will continue to go up in value until they finally reach 10,000 each. Grabbing the sacks will add multipliers (2X, 4X, up to 8X) that will further increase your score.[CR]* There are many cracks in the wood/stone of most levels. Some of these will reveal a fireball that will make your shot fly all over the board. Experiment with throwing at different angles to find these hidden spots.

				<title_clean>Platformers - Osman</title_clean>
				<plot>OSman (c) 1996 Mitchell.[CR]A platform shoot-em-up that doesn't just 'borrow heavily' from Capcom's 1989 classic, "Strider", it blatantly steals from it. The player controls a 'Cannon Dancer' called Kirrin : a highly acrobatic hero who is also a skilled martial arts fighter. Kirrin must jump and fight his way over a number of colourful, intricately-rendered levels in his bid to defeat the enemy forces. In addition to the many power-ups that are availble to strengthen Kirrin's attacks (with each power-up indicated by a colour change to Kirrin's costume), the player is armed with three 'Magic' attacks per life, which work in a similar fashion to those of Sega's "Shinobi".[CR]The Strider-esque gameplay is, if anything, an improvement over the illustrious game upon which it is based. As well as the mandatory improved graphics, understandable given the six years that separates the two games, OSman's level design is hugely inventive and offers more variety than Strider's stages.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : ARM (@ 28 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : OKI6295 (@ 7.627 Khz), OKI6295 (@ 15.255 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; [A] Attack, [B] Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in February 1996.[CR]This game is known in Japan as "Cannon Dancer".[CR]This game is often compared to "Strider", and the main reason for that being because in the early 90's several Capcom employees went to Mitchell including Isuke, the original Game Planner for Capcom's "Strider".

				<title_clean>Platformers - Pac-Land</title_clean>
				<plot>Pac-Land (c) 1984 Namco.[CR]Pac-Land is a horizontally-scrolling platform game set in the cartoon world of the game's title. A fairy has lost her way and needs Pac-Man to help her get back to her home of Fairyland. Pac-Man, with the fairy safely hidden beneath his hat, must run and jump through the colourful world until he reaches and enters the magical door to Fairyland. Upon being rescued, the fairy gives Pac-Man a pair of magical shoes for his trip back home. These enable him to jump wherever he wants, without the need for a platform to jump from. This effectively means Pac-Man can 'sky-jump' back home if he so wishes.[CR]Directional buttons make Pac-Man walk left and right and it's possible to make him run by tapping the desired directional button twice. Pac-Man is pursued by his ever-present enemies in the form of five ghosts - Pinky, Inky, Blinky, Clyde and Sue. Pac-Man must avoid the ghosts and other deadly objects that populate the levels. As with previous games in the series, a small number of 'Powerpills' appear. Eating a Powerpill makes Pac-Man temporarily invincible and turns the ghosts purple and vulnerable to being eaten. On some stages, Pac-Man must use a springboard to jump over large ponds by leaping from the springboard and rapidly moving left and right while in the air.[CR]The game's stages are called 'trips', with players able to start on any one of the first five. Each trip made up of four rounds (three rounds to reach Fairyland and one round to return home) with a short interval between each one. The objective in all trips is to get the fairy safely back to Fairyland then return home to Pac-Man's family. The majority of the trip involves moving from left to right, avoiding various obstacles such as the enemy ghosts, water spurts and quicksand traps. The journey home, however, scrolls right to left.[CR]Each stage must be completed within a set time limit and if the player runs out of time before finishing a round, Sue (the purple ghost) will speed up considerably and kill Pac-Man. At the end of each round, players are awarded bonus points based on how much of the time limit remains. On each stage, cherries and other items can be collected for extra points. There are a total of 8 different trips in the game, totalling 32 levels. After the 8th trip, the 9th trip is a repeat of the 5th trip, with level 33 effectively being level 17, with an increased difficulty level.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : PL[CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 1.536 Mhz), Hitachi HD63701 (@ 1.536 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Namco 8-channel WSG[CR]Players : 2[CR]Buttons : 3 (RUN LEFT, RUN RIGHT, JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Pac-Land was released in August 1984 in Japan. [CR]This game was influenced by Hanna-Barbera's Pac-Man cartoon, which ran from 1982-84. The character designs and music are taken directly from the show. The background music that plays during the levels is the same as the cartoon's theme song. [CR]Mark Mendes holds the official record for this game with 4,150,400 points.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The Midway version allows the player to start on any one of the game's first five 'trips', whereas the Japanese version starts only on the first stage. Also, the gameplay in the Japanese set is much slower than that of the Midway set, making for an easier game. [CR]The Japanese set also has some minor graphical differences to the Midway version. Pac-Man's nose is longer, and the hat he wears has a feather in it. Also, when Pac-Man completes a stage and returns home to his family, only Ms. Pac-Man and Baby Pac-Man are waiting to greet him. Chomp-Chomp and Sour Puss, the pet dog and cat who appear in both the Midway sets and the cartoon on which the game is based, are both missing.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]Round 1 - Jumping on the first three fire hydrants to generate five cherries is quite safe as you don't have any cars until after the third hydrant. Continuing, you can see another fire hydrant just after the Pac-Pill. Straight after getting this, you can push the fire hydrant backwards, getting a helmet. This enables you to collect the babies that the ghosts throw from their planes (you lose your hat if you run out of time or die).[CR]Round 2 - The Forest : The first 'cheat' is achieved by pushing the second cactus back -  giving you 80,000 points and transporting you to your house at the end of level two. If this doesn't work, then try the second, third, and fourth logs in the woods. The machine randomly chooses one of these (pushing the logs only works if you haven't died and you have 15,000 points). Get the cherry that appears as it turns into another three.[CR]Round 3 - The mountains : These have no cheats, but watch out for the plane that always flies over the first mountain. (A flower sometimes grows here and in many other places, I am sure that this means nothing.) After completing the mountains, you pass two cacti. Pushing the first one back, on earlier versions, makes you invisible and invincible to everything except the water (which just happens to be the next obstacle!) To jump over the water, run at full speed over the spring board, and at the edge, press jump and keep on whacking the joystick to the right - you should glide over the pool! You have then reached Fairyland! Here the Queen gives you a gift of magic boots that enable you to fly. You then start Round 4 going back the opposite way.[CR]Round 4 - Journey home : You first encounter cacti that you must jump over. If at any point you see the letter 'S' in a Pac bubble flying about, get it - it's an extra life. There is also another letter in a Pac bubble that flies around the screen - the letter 'L' - this can be achieved after getting a Pac-Pill, getting four ghosts and then Doris fifth (Doris is the one that chases you and the only one that has no hat after eating a Pac-Pill). The last cactus that you jump over is very tall. Try pushing the lower section of it backwards as this generates seven balloons, six of which are worth 100 points but one is worth 7,650 points. Get this and don't bother with the others. Continue going home once you reach the town, jump on all fire hydrants as this always generates cherries. If pushing the cactus back didn't do anything, then try pushing the second to last fire hydrant back - this will generate the balloons. When you arrive home, you can still jump to get 7,650 points.[CR]Round 5 - The Town : Jump on the fire hydrants to generate cherries. Push the third hydrant back to give you the hat. If you pass two fire hydrants on top of each other, then jump on top of these. The blue things that push you along (water jets) can also push you on top of the houses. This is advisable as it keeps you away from any double decker buses! If the second fire hydrant didn't give the helmet then the fourth fire hydrant along will.[CR]Round 6 - The water pool area : You have two short(ish) pools to clear, followed by more ghosts on pogo sticks (here appears another floating cherry). The last pool is the longest of these and must be judged carefully to clear.[CR]Round 7 - The water jets : You have three different platforms to jump on. Always try to stay on the highest one. If a flying water jet happens to hit you then whack the joystick everywhere and press fire as it is possible to escape. Not much on this round, just collect loads of strawberries. After this you reach fairyland again, you receive the boots again, and have to return home.[CR]Round 8 - The trip home : Firstly, you have to cross the long pool - backwards. Jump to the top of the screen straight away to get the cherries and clear the planes. There are stumps sticking out that you can land on and get cherries. After this there is the forest to complete. The first or second to last log will give the balloons. [CR]Round 9 - The Water Pool Area : You leave your house and go straight into the water pool area. There are three cacti on this round. Pushing either the first (before the pool), second (before the skeleton) or third (before the Pac-pill) back will give you the helmet. The pool is slightly different as it has a stump sticking out of the water that has an extra spring board you can land on. After this there is a skeleton (that drags you down into the ground) and must be jumped over.[CR]Round 10 - The forest : Pushing one of the logs back will make you invincible to the ghosts. This works even if you have died. When you start flashing, the invincibility is about to wear off.[CR]Round 11 - The logs and clouds : Much like the one on Trip 1 except after jumping the logs, you have to jump onto clouds (although not essential as Pac can clear all the cloud jumps in one). After this you reach Fairyland yet again and you receive the boots.[CR]Round 12 - The trip home : First collect the three cherries. Then you have to jump backwards over a large pool - with no stumps. After this you reach the town. One of the few fire hydrants gives the balloons.[CR]Round 13 - The Town : This level has many double hydrants. Jump on these and wait for the water jet to push you up onto the houses. Walking along the houses gives you some cherries. On many versions there is no helmet on this round.[CR]Round 14 - The cavern : You have to collect the keys to open the doors. The first key is on the top layer. Jump up there to get it. Keep going right and fall down the hole. Keep going right and fall down the next one, too (you should now be on the bottom layer). Keep going right (staying on this level) and open the door. Keep going right. Jump up through the next hole and get the apples. Continue right, fall down the hole and get the key. Use this immediately to open the door. Keep going right, do not jump through the first hole and stay on the lowest level. You can then get two apples, jump through the hole and get a key, and then fall through another hole to get another two apples. Continue right and after opening the door, jump through the holes to get from the bottom level to the top. Open the door you reach and go through. Fall through the next two holes (so that you are back on the lowest level). Open the door you reach and get the two apples. Return through the door you've just come through, jump to the middle layer and continue right. You will now be out of the cavern and have reached 'break time'. So long as you don't waste time and keys it is actually easy.[CR]Round 15 - The water jets : I think that pushing one of these fire hydrants may give the helmet, but I'm not too sure. Watch out for the planes at the very end of the level. Try to jump on them.[CR]Round 16 - The trip home : The first gives the balloons. Next it's the mountains. There is normally an extra life lurking around the second mountain so go backwards once for it if it doesn't come (an 'S' in a Pac). Then it's the forest. The first log encountered gives the balloons if the cactus didn't.[CR]Round 17 - A forest level : On some versions of the machine the very first cactus will give the helmet. Just before the water is a Pac-Pill and it is quite easy to get the time bonus. After the pool, there is a short forest, following that is a spring board that must be used to clear a second pool that cannot be seen from that point.[CR]Round 18 - The cavern : You only have limited sight. The first key is on the lower level. Go right, then jump up to the middle level, then jump up to the top layer. Keep going right and fall down a hole to the middle layer (you'll be in between two doors). Jump back up to the top level (making sure you don't open either of these). Once back on the top level, keep going right and you'll reach a door. Open it and get the key directly behind. Keep going right, fall down to the middle layer, get the key, fall down to the lower level, and collect the fruit. Open the door you come across. Don't jump through the next hole, but through the one after that. Jump to get the key (fall straight back down again). Keep going right. Jump up through the next hole, go right, and fall down the next. Open the next door (you're still on the bottom level) and jump through the next hole. Then jump up to the top level, open the door and get the fruit. Go through on the top and open the end door. Fall through the holes and go to the bottom level. Go right and collect the fruit there. Finally, go to the middle level and exit to 'Break Time'.[CR]Round 19 - The mountains : Clear these and the clouds as usual, but watch out for the planes at the end (over the part with three sets of moving logs). Enter Fairyland.[CR]Round 20 - The return home : This is very easy. Keep on going left, You first hit a forest. Watch out for the ghost near the end. This is followed by a pool, get all the cherries on the way, but DON'T stop for anything. Then you reach another forest, then another pool, then the last forest (watch out for another ghost here) and then the town. By the time you reach the town you will be out of time and must run full speed from Doris. Try to get the Pac-Pill but if you miss it, don't go back for it![CR]Round 21 - The town : This is hard as there are so many ghosts. It is pointless jumping onto the double hydrants as getting on top of the houses may involve hitting a plane. Try to stay on the top of the double-decker buses, jumping from one to another. This will stop you needing a run up. The Pac-Pill at the end can only be got by first jumping onto a ghost. Don't bother with it unless you are already on a ghost. Go straight for 'Break Time'.[CR]Round 22 - The mountains : As well as the clouds, you meet a new section - four logs in water that must be jumped onto and crossed. Careful judgment is needed here. Get the Pac-Pill afterward as you'll need it. Time is short so don't stop for anything.[CR]Round 23 - The water jets : This gets hard towards the end as there are many ghosts around. Try to stay on the planes. You then reach Fairyland.[CR]Round 24 - The trip home : First are the water jets to cross. This is quite easy as there aren't many ghosts and enables you to collect a lot of fruit. Then you enter the town. The last part of this is very hard. Just jump for the Pac-Pill when you see it and hope you get it before you are killed! Don't wait around.[CR]Round 25 - The woods : There are two woods split up by lots of skeletons. DON'T use the spring board or you will hit one of the planes. All of the skeletons are fake apart from the first and last. So don't worry about touching them. When you enter the first wood, look for the helmet at the fourth log. I think it is hidden in there.[CR]Round 26 - The mountains - again! : This time you don't have many logs to jump on and there are very few clouds. Most of the mountains have to be jumped without any clouds. This level also contains the logs in water and is the furthest that I've ever got.[CR]* The appearance of special items in Pac-Land is NOT random. The position in which they appear depends on the last two digits of the player's score when starting a round. The table below gives the position of the obstacle which needs to be pushed to reveal the secret. In the table, R stands for Round No., F for feature (H=Helmet, W=Warp, T=Transparency, B=Balloons). The relevant obstacle number is given in each column for each score. For example, when first starting a game, the last two digits will obviously be 00, so the helmet appears by pushing the 4th hydrant. If, on the second round, the player starts with e.g. 20,020 points, then the warp will be hidden in the 2nd tree stump and so on. Some rounds have no hidden items. Now, when running from left to right, the obstacles are counted as the player meets them, BUT for return journeys (right-&gt;left), the numbering is different, only the LAST four obstacles are relevant. For example, on Round 4, Obstacle 1 is the last large cactus the player meets, Obstacles 2, 3, and 4 are the three hydrants in the town (numbered from right to left). All obstacles must be pushed in the opposite direction that Pac-Man must run in to reach his goal.[CR]R   F 00 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90[CR]1   H  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1[CR]2   W  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1[CR]3   T  1  2  1  2  1  2  1  2  1  2[CR]4   B  1  4  3  2  1  4  3  2  1  4[CR]5   H  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1[CR]7   T  1  1  2  3  1  1  2  3  1  1[CR]8   B  1  4  3  2  1  4  3  2  1  4[CR]9   H  1  1  2  3  1  1  2  3  1  1[CR]11* T    OK  OK      OK  OK      OK*[CR]12* B    OK  OK      OK  OK      OK*[CR]13  H  1  1  2  3  1  1  2  3  1  1[CR]15  T  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1[CR]16  B  1  2  1  2  1  2  1  2  1  2[CR]17  H  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1[CR]20  B  1  4  3  2  1  4  3  2  1  4[CR]23  T  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1[CR]24  B  1  4  3  2  1  4  3  2  1  4[CR]25  H  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1[CR]27  T  4  1  2  3  4  1  2  3  4  1[CR]*There is only one obstacle on Rounds 11 and 12.[CR]The helmet gives protection from falling monsters, and gives points for every one collected.

				<title_clean>Platformers - Penguin Brothers</title_clean>
				<plot>Penguin Brothers (c) 2000 Subsino.[CR]A multi-screen platform game in which one or two players (either co-operatively or competitively) control a cute penguin fighting against the game's equally cute enemies. The idea is to destroy all of the on-screen enemies; once this a done, a circular key will appear; the player must pick the key up, whereupon they will be teleported to another screen which represents the second part of the stage. This screen has a silver doorway; the player must carry the key to the door - avoiding or destroying the on-screen enemies - to complete the level.[CR]Playing as a loose cross between Taito's "Bubble Bobble" and Irem's "Bomber Man", each player's penguin is armed with bombs which are used to destroy the game's enemies, as well as obstructions - such as walls etc. - and barrels; the latter often revealing hidden bonuses that can be collected. Players must be careful to avoid blowing themselves and each other up when the bombs detonate.[CR]Each level contains one or more 'rotating' platforms, allowing travel between upper and lower platforms. Players and enemies can stick to the underside of a rotating platform, then rotate it through 180 degrees to reach the platform above them. The opposite applies to reach a lower platform.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 16.2652 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : X1-010 (@ 16.66 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Penguin Brothers was released in October 2000.[CR]A Hack of this game are known as "Super Panda".[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Producers : Masanori Kagawa (NSI), Seiji Kurokawa (ADD), Tadayuki Emori (EMS)[CR]Game designer : Ago[CR]System programmer : M.

				<title_clean>Platformers - Rod-Land</title_clean>
				<plot>Rod-Land (c) 1990 Jaleco.[CR]Rod-Land is a cute and colourful platform game for one or two players in which two fairy sisters - 'Tam' and 'Rit' - must rescue their kidnapped mother from the 'Maboots Tower' fortress.[CR]The fairies are armed with the 'Rods of Sheesanomo' - two magical rods that enable the fairies to catch enemies in a force-field and slam them into the platforms to kill them - and must clear each level of enemies to move onto the next and eventually reach and infiltrate the Tower.[CR]As well as the magical rods used for attacking enemies, the fairies can also create a magical ladder - in a fashion very similar to that used in Taito's "Rainbow islands" - which can be utilised anywhere on a level and allows players to reach other platforms or escape from pursuing enemies. Each player can utilise only one magically-created ladder at any one time and the creation of a new ladder removes the previously-created one.[CR]A level is only completed when all enemies have been killed. Some defeated enemies drop bonus items, such as fruit, missiles and bombs.[CR]Each of the game's levels features brightly coloured flowers. If players manage to collect all of these, the 'Extra Game' mode begins. During this time-limited mode all of the level's enemies turn red and move much faster. If the enemies are killed in time, they drop an alphabetic letter that can be collected to spell the word 'EXTRA' and earn players an extra life.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Jaleco Mega System 1-A hardware[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 7 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.5 Mhz), (2x) OKI6295 (@ 30.303 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (Catch, Create magical ladder)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in April 1990.[CR]This game is known in Japan as "Rod Land - Haha wo Motomete 30 Kai".[CR]Rod-Land contains a second episode (see 'Tips And Tricks' section) known in Japan as "Rod Land - Tozasareta Sekai".

				<plot>Shadow Dancer - Kage no Mai (c) 1989 Sega.[CR]A loose sequel to 1988's "Shinobi", Shadow Dancer stars a young Ninja who, together with his faithful canine companion, must battle against a terrorist group. The terrorist group have planted a number of time bombs throughout the metropolis. The Ninja and his dog must set out to gather up all the explosives placed by the evil gang and to annihilate the criminal mastermind.[CR]Game-play is very similar to that of the original Shinobi, and features the jumping and projectile weapon-based game-play of its illustrious older brother. However, a new and crucial attacking move has since been added to the Ninja's arsenal. Pulling DOWN on the joystick and pressing the ATTACK button sends the hero's dog to attack the nearest enemy. This will stop the enemy from attacking the player as he wrestles with the dog. The enemy must be killed quickly, however, or the dog itself will be killed. If the dog is attacked, he will turn into a small puppy, and once the player has killed a set number of enemies, the puppy will grow to be a full-sized dog who can once again be used to attack enemies.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "System 18" hardware.[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons: 3 (ATTACK, JUMP, MAGIC)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in December 1989.[CR]The subtitle of this game translates from Japanese as 'Dance of Shadows'.[CR]The identity of the main character differs between the supplemental materials of the game's various home versions.[CR]* In the Japanese Mega Drive version, the main character is named Hayate and is characterized as the son of Joe Musashi (the game being set 20 years after original Shinobi).

				<plot>Shinobi (c) 1987 Sega Enterprises, Limited.[CR]Shinobi is a scrolling platform beat-em-up in which the player takes on the role of Joe Musashi, a Shinobi Ninja, who must fight his way through 5 tough missions - each made up of between 3 to 5 stages - in his quest to rescue the kidnapped Ninja children of the Iga clan; now hostages of an evil Ninja syndicate called "Zeed". To complete a mission, the player must rescue all of the kidnapped children on each level, with the number of hostages remaining displayed on a meter in the bottom left corner of the screen.[CR]The Shinobi Ninja begins each level armed with either 'shuriken' throwing stars or a gun for long-range attacks; and a Samurai sword for close-range combat. In addition, the Ninja also has one 'Magic Attack' per level; a smart bomb which kills or damages all on-screen enemies. A points bonus is awarded whenever a level is completed without the Magic Attack being used. An end-of-level guardian awaits the player at the end of each mission, and each takes several hits before it is killed. Once a boss is defeated, the player is taken to a bonus stage in which a large number of Ninjas will try to 'jump' from the back of the screen to the front to attack the player. A bonus life is awarded if the player manages to kill all of the Ninjas without being attacked.[CR]Shinobi was a huge success for Sega, and deservedly so. Its perfectly realized blend of platform and fighting action and is as fine an exponent of the 'easy to get into, difficult to master' gameplay ethic as video games have seen.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the Sega "System 16B" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 317-0049[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 3 [CR]=&gt; Attack, Jump, Magic[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Shinobi was released in November 1987 in Japan.[CR]Re-Editions:[CR]"Shinobi [Model 317-0050]" (16A)[CR]"Shinobi [Model 317-0054]"[CR]Shinobi was one of the many names given to the ninja in feudal Japan. Its literal translation is 'stealer-in'; a reference to what Ninjas specialized in above all else. By employing any number of tricks such as stealth walking and staying upwind of any guard animals, the Shinobi went undetected about his mission. On a more devious level, the Shinobi was also a master of disguise, and would often 'steal in' to village communities disguised as a local, or into enemy palaces disguised as a wandering priest.[CR]Marilyn Monroe's face appears on several posters in the Mission 1 second stage.[CR]A Shinobi cabinet can be seen in the Nickelodeon show All That (from 1997 to 2000). however it used a fictional marquee which was made for the show.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Scoring in this game is very easy. Each enemy is worth 100 points with the exception of the Purple Guard and the Sword Throwing Guard which are worth 500 points. The bosses are 5,000 points apiece. NOTE : The Purple Guards and Sword Throwing Guards are the ones that guard the hostages.[CR]In addition to getting points from killing enemies, you can also score points for time left on the clock after you complete a level. You get 30 points per second of remaining time.[CR]You can also receive special bonuses at the end of each level for certain actions :[CR]1) If you don't use your ninja magic, you get a 5,000 point bonus.[CR]2) If you only use your Ninja-to sword (no Shurikens or gunfire), you get a 20,000 point bonus.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Unless you are continuing, each game begins at 'Mission 1' and will have everything you need to complete each mission. Each level must be completed within 3 minutes, and all hostages must be rescued before you can exit the level. If you are killed, all hostages rescued prior to your death will still be recorded as rescued. In addition to melee attacks, you will also be able to use a specific Ninja Magic attack once per level. These magical attacks kill everything that is on the screen but you will be awarded a point bonus if you manage to complete a level WITHOUT using your Ninja Magic. The three Ninja Magic attacks are :[CR]1) Multiple-Attack Magic : Allows you to gain lightning-fast speed to attack up to 12 times at once.[CR]2) Tornado Magic : Brings about a magical tornado to blow your enemies away.[CR]3) Lightning Magic : Causes the air to crackle with electricity and destroys your enemies.[CR]* Some general gameplay guidelines :[CR]1) Joe is strictly a one-hit, one-kill character, so you must avoid all enemy attacks or risk losing a life.[CR]2) As you become more practiced at moving around, you won't have to rely on your distance weapons (throwing stars etc.) and can use your ninja sword for close-up kills; the advantage of this is that you can gain the 20,000 point bonus. This also applies to the use of Ninja Magic.[CR]3) Many of the enemies in the later missions will swarm Joe and attack in numbers, it's vitally important to learn to attack-and-jump as quickly as possible otherwise you will be quickly overrun.[CR]4) Your main goal is, of course, to rescue all the hostages to exit the level; and although three minute time limit initially seems quite generous, should you delay too long with the enemies, the time will quickly run out.[CR]5) It's important to become good at the Challenge Levels, since this is the only way to gain extra lives. The Challenge levels will require you to take out around thirty ninjas who are trying to get to your position. There is no real hard and fast strategy other then take them down before they reach the second platform. Challenge Levels occur at the end of every mission.[CR]6) Ninja Magic is a great thing. You must remember, though, that you can only use it once per level. This means you should only use it when you are totally surrounded by enemies and have no other means of escape.[CR]7) All bosses take eight hits to defeat. Of course, you will have to hit them in the right place for that hit to register.[CR]* Stop Gunners : In levels with Bazooka-toting enemies (Rounds 3-2), push one of them against a wall about ten times (always pushing on his direction, never stopping), you'll see then that all Bazooka men and Gun men are no longer able to use their weapons against you.[CR]* Extra lives from hostages : In game are special hostage, you can get 1UP instead points from them. These hostages are : 2nd hostage on stage 2-2, 1st hostage on 2-3, 2nd hostage on 3-1, 5th hostage on 3-2. What you must do to get 1UP instead points? When you get hostage you must have 3 identical digits at end of your score (don't count last digit which is always 0). Example : 70,000, 100,000, 109,990, 68,880, 141110. 1UP icon will appear instead points icon over hostage.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Shinobi [Model 317-0049] (1987, Arcade)[CR]2.

The snowmen must throw snowballs at the enemies, eventually encasing them completely in snow. The encased enemies must them be kicked in order to destroy them. This is achieved by standing next to the snowball and pressing the "kick out" button, which sends the giant snowball flying around the screen, killing any enemies that lay in its path. During every 10th level, the players must face and defeat an end-of-level boss.[CR]A number of power-ups are available, in the form of coloured potions. The power-ups are as follows :[CR]* Yellow = Long shot[CR]* Red = Speed up[CR]* Blue = Bigger snowballs (encases monsters quicker)[CR]* Green = Inflates the players like a balloon and lets them fly around the screen, killing any monsters they touch.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : MIN16-02[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 6 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : YM3812 (@ 3 Mhz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 256 x 224 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 57.50 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 256[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Snow Bros. was released in April 1990. [CR]Like Taito's "Liquid Kids", Snow Bros. was licensed to Manchester's Ocean Software for conversion to both the Atari ST and the Commodore Amiga home computers but, again like "Liquid Kids", Ocean decided that the game wouldn't perform well at retail and the game was cancelled. It has since been released, in its entirety, to the emulation community and is a fine conversion.[CR]This game was released as a conversion kit only (often factory installed in a generic cabinet), so any such machine could be converted into a proper Snow Bros. machine. This title is JAMMA compatible (the circuit board for it is one of the smallest ever made, it is barely larger than a Nintendo Famicom cartridge). The marquee for this title shows a 'Snow Bros.' logo, with two snowmen, and a couple of cartoon enemies in the background - in keeping with the game's 'cute' theme.[CR]Licensed to Romstar for USA distribution.[CR]A bootleg of this game is known as "The Winter Bobble".[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Out Zone, Snow Bros. - PCCB-00044) on 21/10/1990.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Killing all the monsters on a level with a single snowball causes money bonuses, worth 10,000 points, to fall down, but sometimes a glowing cake bonus will appear instead. When the cake is collected, the game stops and four blue snowball creatures appear for a short time. If these enemies are killed, they each provide a letter : S,N,O or W. Collect all four of these letters for an extra life. The glowing cake can also appear at other times during the game.[CR]* Hidden Functions : If the 'Invulnerability dip switch' is enabled, you are invulnerable but you may also 'Pause' the game with P2 Start and restart with P1 Start.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Spelunker (c) 1986 Irem Corp.[CR]In Spelunker - which means 'cave-diver' - a caver has to work his way down through a number of multi-directionally scrolling caves - each one deeper underground than the last - in his bid to find the mythical 'World of Wonders'. To do this, the spelunker must find the exit to each cave, so he can move on to the next and get closer to his goal.[CR]Spelunker is a platform game, and each tricky cave is filled with enemies - such as bats and ogres - and traps. Ladders, ropes, lifts and the obligatory minecarts must be used to reach other platforms and sections of the cave.[CR]To aid him in his difficult quest, the Spelunker carries a gun and can shoot short-range fireballs at his enemies to stun or kill them. Numerous bonus items can be collected, such as bombs to destroy any rocks block his route, keys to open locked doors and potions to boost the caver's ever-decreasing energy meter. Treasure chests also litter each cave, and can be opened for bonus treasure items.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Irem M-62 system hardware[CR]Main CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola M6803 (@ 894.886 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : (2x) General Instrument AY8910 (@ 894.886 Khz), (2x) MSM5205 (@ 384 Khz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 384 x 256 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 55.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 512[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in February 1986 by Irem, under license from Broderbund.[CR]Originally released in 1984 by Broderbund Software for the Commodore C64 computer.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Vs. Super Mario Bros. (c) 1986 Nintendo.[CR]Classic and cult horizontal platform game featuring the Nintendo mascot Mario who must save princess Toadstool (Princess Peach in Japan) from Bowser (Koopa in Japan).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Vs. Super Mario Bros. is most common in a converted "Donkey Kong" or "Donkey Kong Junior" cabinet (this game was only available as a kit, there were no dedicated cabinets made). Actually, any copy of this game that is not in a converted Donkey Kong series cabinet is incorrect (as the Vs. kit was only designed for those cabinets). Nintendo designed a special small joystick for their Vs. Unisystem games (allowing a 2 player setup on the tiny Donkey Kong control panel). Another difference between this title and most standard games was audio that was processed in the monitor (although this was the same as most other early Nintendo titles). One other notable thing about this title is that either joystick will control either player (most Vs. titles were like this), making it rather pointless to have 2 sticks in the first place.[CR]Main CPU : Zetex N2A03 (@ 1.789772 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Zetex N2A03 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), DAC[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 256 x 240 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 64[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in April 1986.[CR]Basically, this is the arcade port of the Nintendo Famicom "Super Mario Bros.". There are slight differences:[CR]* Item placement in the '?' and hidden blocks differs slightly, so if you're used to the Playchoice-10 version you may find a few different and unexpected items in certain familiar places.[CR]* Parts of levels were also changed slightly, too, the most noticeable being a gap in the ceiling bricks on the way to the Warp Zone in World 1-2.[CR]* This seems to make the World -1 trick impossible to do on Vs. Super Mario Bros., as it involved the use of these removed bricks.[CR]* More enemies added in most levels[CR]* Bug fixes / preventions.[CR]This game is also known as "Vs. Mario's Adventure".[CR]A hack of this game where made by Two-Bits Score and is known as "Skate Kid Bros.".[CR]Michael Jackson used to own this game. It was sold at the official Michael Jackson Auction on Apr. 24th, 2009.[CR]A Vs. Super Mario Bros. unit appears in the sitcom 'Two and a Half Men'; Season 5, Episode 2 (People Who Love Peepholes).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Increase The Number Of Marios By 100 Or More : There is a way of increasing the number of Marios by more than 100. At the end of World 3-1, when Koopa Troopa comes on the block stairway just before the flagpole... and reaches the lowest step, jump on him to make him stop moving.[CR]* The 999 Timer Bonus Trick : This one can be done on any of the -4 Worlds. It is most difficult to achieve on World 6-4 and World 7-4. What you do is try to end the level with the timer at 000, and the machine will act as though you have 1000 units of time instead of 0. It will drop to 999 and count down to 000 from there and award points for each unit of time. Simply jump to the axe as the timer goes from 002 to 001 and you should finish the screen with the timer at 000 and get the maximum bonus.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Designed by video game legend : Shigeru Miyamoto[CR]Music &amp; sound by : Koji Kondo[CR]</plot>

				<plot>The New Zealand Story (c) 1988 Taito Corp.[CR]Set in Antipodean country of the game's title, The New Zealand Story is an incredibly cute and challenging platform game featuring Tiki the Kiwi bird, possibly the most lovable arcade character ever created. Tiki's fellow Kiwi birds have been kidnapped by an evil walrus and Tiki is charged with rescuing his friends.[CR]The New Zealand Story is a superb, constantly inventive and very demanding platform game that features a wide variety of intelligent and distinctive enemies; such as heavily armed ducks, angry walruses, and whales made of ice that spit giant snowflakes.[CR]During his quest, Tiki can commandeer a variety of different weapons and vehicles - the latter of which include balloons and a hovercraft. The level design is superb, with exploration often rewarded with either bonus items, alternate routes to the end of the level, or secret level warps that transport the player to a later level (see 'TIPS AND TRICKS' for more details).[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Prom Sticker : B53[CR]Main CPU : (2x) Zilog Z80, I8X41[CR]Sound Chips : YM2203[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]See 'UPDATES' section for more information about the new hardware version...[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in September 1988, the hero of this game, Tiki the kiwi, also appears in other Taito games like "Liquid Kids" ("Mizubaku Daibouken") and "Bubble Symphony" ("Bubble Bobble II") as a guest star.[CR]Zoological Note : Unlike Tiki, a real Kiwi bird is a brown in colour and is roughly the size as a domestic chicken. It is flightless and its distinctive plumage resembles hair more than feathers. The Kiwi bird lives only in New Zealand and, due to its rarity in the wild, is a protected species.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]WORLD NEW VERSION :[CR]* New hardware revision.[CR]* Three Z80 and no M-Chip (8742 MPU).[CR]JAPAN VERSION :[CR]* Standard hardware.[CR]* Two Z80 and the M-Chip.[CR]WORLD OLD VERSION :[CR]* Standard hardware.[CR]* Harder gameplay.[CR]* Old Taito logo.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]The following is for the Japanese version of the game which, curiously, was the version that tended to be converted to the various home formats; regardless of territory[CR]Throughout the game there are several hidden 'Warp' gates, which take you to secret areas and later levels.[CR]Round 1-1 : In the last room of this stage, there are 3 identical platforms placed above one another. Go to the highest one, face left and jump about whilst shooting, after 5 shots a warp should appear. This takes you into a enclosed box on round 2-1, only this time it has got the 'E','X','T' letters. There is an escape warp to the right which you must shoot to make it appear. From here you are taken to round 1-4 (in an inaccessible area below the boss room) where you'll find the green 'E','N','D' letters, you now have your first extra life. To get to know more about round 1-4 (which is important in the game) keep on reading.[CR]Round 1-2 : In the start area, jump onto the second platform and shoot to your left 5 times. A warp should appear, enter it and you'll be taken to a room of the secret round (the secret round is a place where almost ALL of the secret rooms are found - like separate rooms in any level - and you can't visit more than one at a time, since they are all separated by closed walls). There are two large columns with water one to either side of you. Each has an open Warp above it. The right warp will take you to an upper place in level 1-2, where you simply collect some apples (for points) and then continue through the level normally. The left warp, which is the better of the two, takes you to a place under the level. Going from left to right, you find a place with upwards tunnels you can jump in. Go to the one full right, since there you will find the letters 'red E' and 'X'. Then, going all the way up, you are just near the cage at the end of the level.[CR]Round 1-3 : This level has two warps...[CR]1) The first needs a vehicle and is just after you fly down to the big open area of this round.  Fly downwards while staying close to, and facing the left-hand wall, keep firing towards the wall and about two thirds of the way down, the first Warp will appear. This will take you to a secret round where you collect the 'red E','X', 'T','green E' letters then on a hidden place of round 2-1,where you collect the 'N' and 'D' letters : EXTEND, and also you can choose to finish round 2-1 OR...[CR]2) The second Warp is in the last room. Climb out of the water and head straight upwards - the trapped Kiwi is to your left). This will take you to a secret round, which also has got a secret warp in it! The round has the 'TEND' letters, exits to 1-4, and a Warp exit to 2-2.[CR]Round 1-4 : This round has a Warp, but it's only accessible from another Warp that appears on a LATER level (2-1). Once you have come to this level via the Warp on 2-1, go to the platform directly UNDERNEATH the Boss room (after you've collected the letter), the Warp is in the far left corner of the upper-most platform underneath the Boss room and takes you to level 2-4.[CR]Note : The trick of using the 2-1 warp to go back to 1-4 infinitely doesn't work in the WORLD revision. The programmers added some blocks to the box so that the Kiwi cannot be sucker in the warp.[CR]Round 2-1 : This is one of the key rounds of the game, as it allows for one or two tricks and has two warps. The first one is in the right corner of the closed box at the end of the level. You can get inside the box from the warp on level 1-1. However, it's possible to enter the Warp from OUTSIDE the closed box by using a flying vehicle and, for preference the laser weapon or Fire Staff.. If you've only got arrows ,bombs, or a laser and no vehicle, take advantage of the microbes that appear nearby. Keep killing them any time they appear (if you move away from the screen where they appear they will appear more often) until the Fire Staff appears. Once opened, just jump in it from below. You will be taken BACK to the secret area in level 1-4. This means that you can effectively keep going BACK to level 1.4 through the Warp as many times as you wish, stocking up on points and bonus lives as you go.[CR]Should you chose NOT to do this, you can head for the second Warp. First, ensure that when you are at the enclosed box and that you also have a vehicle. Simply fly OVER the enclosed box and drop down behind the caged Kiwi. On your right there is a 'ladder', go up this and you'll be in a small, enclosed room; shoot the lower-left edge of the room and the Warp appears. This will take you to an independent secret level which has 2 possible exits. The first is at the end of the level - after the yellow lift you head down and left and drop through a hole in the floor - this takes you to level 2-3. The second exit is a warp. Stand on the yellow rising block and jump from it so you can stand on the wall to your right (you would do this anyway, to avoid the ceiling spikes and get to the exit...). Shoot 5 times and a Warp appears. This will take you to another secret level - with a number of enemies - and the letters 'Green E' and 'T'. Take the letters, kill all of the enemies and enter the Warp that subsequently appears.[CR]Round 2-2 : The only warp on this level is in the upper right-hand corner and can only be reached with a vehicle. This takes you to the end of the level.[CR]Round 2-3 : Also one warp on this round. This is found in the place left to the 'Red E' (bottom righ of the level). This will take you to a place with a 'Red E' and an 'X', and a warp from there to an advanced point on level 2-3.[CR]Round 2-4 : Before the Boss Room (the one with the octopus) shoot to the right - standing on the blocks over the spikes - and a warp will appear on the fifth block from the left. This leads to a secret level with enemies and the letters 'T' and 'Green E', and THEN to level 3-1, inside the 'box'.[CR]Round 3-2 : There is a warp near to the end of the level on the wall between the two 'pools' of water with waterfalls, This will take you to a room in the secret level, with a church for background. Nothing to take, just a warp on the floor that will take you to level 3-3.[CR]Round 4-1 : This round has got 3 warps, the maximum in this game. The first (and most rewarding) is over the last diagonal row of spikes, in the upper 'dry' part of the level (most of the level is underwater). Fly up there, shoot 5 times as usual and take the warp. It will take you to a place in the secret round and then to level 4-4. There are two further warps that can be found in a long, left-to-right section, just after you have passed the BIG masses of water.[CR]Round 4-4 : This level has two sub-areas, divided by a barrel at the end of the areas. In the area with the horizontal 'barrel', there is an empty space below it. Shoot it and a warp appears. This takes you to a room in level 2-4, with 2 letters, an 'E' and an 'X', and then you take a warp in that room that takes you to the second area of level 4-4.[CR]Round 5-1 : This is the last level known to have a warp. Walk on the floor with the small volcano until the last platforms on the left. Go up and then left, you will fall down to a place with some blocks and more volcanoes. Shoot to the right right, and take the warp. This takes you to a room in the secret round with 2 red E's and another Warp to a secret level room - with two X's - and from there to level 5-1 again, near the big room.[CR]* Heaven Rounds : The heaven levels are secret levels that can only reached when Tiki has lost all of his previous lives and is killed by a SOLID PROJECTYLE (such as arrows, stones, bombs, boomerangs, spears, etc.) If you drown ,fall on spikes or lava, get burned by laser, flames or UFO missiles, or are killed by contact with an enemy, a life is lost. The Heaven levels only appear after level 3.1.[CR]* Teddy Bear Cheat : In the demo mode during the attract mode, press fire 3 times, and a cute picture of a bear will appear in the bottom-left corner of the screen.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Main staff : Kazutomo Ishida, Hisaya Yabusaki, Akira Ootsuki, Makoto Fujita, Koichi Ooyama[CR]Sound effects : Hisayoshi Ogura, Yasuko Yamada, Yasuhisa Watanabe[CR]One-time staff : Mitsukou Kimura, Naoko Toshimitsu[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]NEC PC-Engine [JP] (February 23, 1990) "The New Zealand Story [Model TP02007]" [CR]Sega Mega Drive [JP] (March 3, 1990) "The New Zealand Story [Model T-11013]" [CR]Nintendo NES [EU] [AU] (1991) "The New Zealand Story [Model NES-38]" [CR]Nintendo NES [US] (March 1991) "Kiwi Kraze [Model NES-2K-USA]" [CR]Sega Master System [EU] (1992) "The New Zealand Story [Model 27035]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [JP] (August 25, 2005) "Taito Memories Gekan [Model SLPM-66092]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [EU] (October 14, 2005) "Taito Legends" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [EU] (October 14, 2005) "Taito Legends [Model SLES-53438]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [US] (October 25, 2005) "Taito Legends" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [US] (October 25, 2005) "Taito Legends [Model SLUS-21122]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [KO] (July 18, 2006) "Taito Legends [Model SLKA-15056]" [CR]* Handhelds : [CR]Sony PSP [AS] (January 3, 2006) "Taito Memories Pocket [Model UCAS-40040]" [CR]Sony PSP [JP] (January 5, 2006) "Taito Memories Pocket [Model ULJM-05076]" [CR]Sony PSP [KO] (February 10, 2006) "Taito Memories Pocket" [CR]Sony PSP [EU] (October 6, 2006) "Taito Legends Power-Up [Model ULES-00473]" [CR]Sony PSP [AU] (November 9, 2006) "Taito Legends Power-Up [Model ULES-00473]" [CR]Sony PSP [US] (May 17, 2007) "Taito Legends Power-Up [Model ULUS-10208]" [CR]Nintendo DS [AU] (January 25, 2007) "New Zealand Story Revolution [Model NTR-ANZP-AUS]" [CR]Nintendo DS [EU] (February 2, 2007) "New Zealand Story Revolution [Model NTR-ANZP-EUR]" [CR]Nintendo DS [JP] (May 31, 2007) "New Zealand Story DS [Model NTR-ANZJ-JPN]" [CR]Nintendo DS [US] (February 13, 2008) "New Zealand Story Revolution [Model NTR-ANZE-USA]" [CR]* Computers : [CR]Sinclair ZX Spectrum [EU] (1989) [CR]Commodore C64 [US] [EU] (1989) [CR]Atari ST [EU] (1989) [CR]Amstrad CPC [EU] (1989) [CR]Commodore Amiga [EU] (1989) [CR]FM Towns PC [JP] (1989) [CR]Sharp X68000 [JP] (July 15, 1989) [CR]Amstrad CPC [FR] (1990) "Le Monde des Merveilles" [CR]Amstrad CPC [EU] (1991) "Addicted To Fun - Rainbow Collection" [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [EU] (October 14, 2005) "Taito Legends" [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [US] (November 10, 2005) "Taito Legends"[CR]</plot>

				<title_clean>Platformers - Tumble Pop</title_clean>
				<plot>Tumble Pop (c) 1991 Data East Corporation.[CR]Tumble Pop is a platform game for one or two players in which the aim is to clear each level of enemies by sucking them into - then ejecting them from - a portable vacuum-cleaner. [CR]Holding down the fire button sucks the enemies into the cleaner, releasing the button causes them to be expelled back out. Ejected enemies act as projectiles that can damage and kill any other on-screen enemies that they collide with. All enemies must be killed before players can progress to the next stage. [CR]Throughout the game, letters of the alphabet randomly appear in bubbles. These can be collected to eventually spell the word "TUMBLEPOP". Once this has been achieved players are transported to a time-limited bonus level, giving them the opportunity to earn bonus points and extra lives. [CR]If players take too long to finish a stage, a Dracula-like enemy appears. If it touches a player before all enemies have been eliminated, a life is lost. This also applies to the Boss levels. [CR]The game feature ten stages, with the first eight set in different parts of the World and the final two set in Outer Space. Each stage has its own themed enemies and level bosses and players can choose to start the game on any of the eight World-based stages. The levels and enemies are: [CR]*Moscow: Set at the Moscow-state circus, enemies are clowns, invisible conjurers and fire spitters. The boss is a giant clown hanging from helium balloons who juggles bombs. [CR]*Egypt: Set near the pyramids and Sphinx at Giza, enemies include fire spitters and mummies. The boss is a giant genie who spits fireballs. [CR]*Paris: Set near the Arc de Triomphe, all of the enemies are robots. The boss is a large flying robot that sends out flying hands. [CR]*New York City: Set near the Statue of Liberty and World Trade Center, the enemies are pumpkin-headed zombies and octopuses. The boss is a giant octopus. [CR]*Rio de Janeiro: Set near the statue of Christ the Redeemer, enemies are fire monsters. The boss is a fire dragon. [CR]*Antarctica: Populated by snowmen, snowmen armed with shovels and hairy yeti-like monsters. The boss is a giant snowman wearing a bucket on its head. [CR]*Australia. Enemies are carnivorous plants, cavemen and mud men. The boss is a giant two-headed carnivorous plant. [CR]*Japan: Set at Mount Fuji, enemies are yureis, kappas and skeletons. The boss is a giant pile of daruma dolls. [CR]*Outer Space: Enemies are grey aliens and spacemen with blaster guns. The boss is a flying robot. [CR]*The Moon: All bosses from the previous worlds must be fought again. The game's final boss is a cyborg mad scientist controlling a giant robot.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : MAP[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 14 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Hudson Soft HuC6280 (@ 4.0275 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.58 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 6.06 Khz)[CR]Screen Orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video Resolution : 319 x 240 Pixels[CR]Screen Refresh : 58.00 Hz [CR]Palette Colors : 1024[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR]=&gt; Fire, Jump[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Tumble Pop was released in November 1991.[CR]Tumble Pop is the first of a trilogy of similar games produced by Data East, all with the same gameplay but at least with just few differences : a year after Tumble Pop, in 1992 Data East released "Diet Go Go", similar to Tumble Pop in the game mechanics, but the vacuum cleaner are discarded with special fruits released by the players for pump up the enemies; at this point the enemy will fly up to the screen, and the player spin him against the other enemies simply by touching him while he's flying. In 1994 is released '"Joe &amp; Mac Returns", still similar to Tumble Pop, but the players must first dizzy the enemies with their canes, then capturing them and at least throw against the other enemies. [CR]There are several references with other Data East games with the enemies of Tumble Pop :[CR]* First of all, the fat Arabian-type guy spitting flames from his mouth is, naturally, a retrieval of the good old Karnov, even if it's not too identical to the original in the aesthetics (the eating-fire guy of Tumblepop doesn't have the thin mustache, and even the eyes are different). This enemy appears in the stage of Russia, Egypt and Brazil.[CR]* In the Australia stage, the cavemen and carnivorous plants are the same as those appearing in Caveman Ninja. The end level boss is identical to the Giant Carnivorous Plant of the second stage, still on Caveman Ninja.[CR]* The end level boss of Brazil stage (the fire dragon) is almost identical to the mid boss of the second stage of Chelnov - Atomic Runner (the Giant Dog with iron mask). Some of his patterns are also similar to another boss in Caveman Ninja.[CR]* The 'pain scream' of some bosses was copied from the Dinosaurs growl of Caveman Ninja.[CR]* In the Space stages, one enemy (the alien with white suit and helmet) is exactly identical to Chelnov. Even his fire attacks are identical to one of the power ups of the game Chelnov - Atomic Runner.[CR]In the Brazil stage, in the first scheme there are five special letters hidden (See TIPS AND TRICKS section to learn more about the special letters) that joined together forms the name SENNA,: clearly an homage to the late Brazilian F1 world champion Ayrton Senna.[CR]In 1994 an anonymous Korean software house, Dong Gue La Mi Ltd., made a hack version of this game, named "Pang Pang". This game is simply awful, with all the backgrounds of the original game changed to the backgrounds of Super Pang. Also, you can't catch the enemies with the vacuum cleaner, but you can catch them inside some bubbles, exactly like in Bubble Bobble. The main character of the game controlled by the player is a horrible rip-off of the hero of Tumble Pop.[CR]The final boss and villain of the game, Mad Doctor, appears also in "Diet Go Go" and "Spin Masters", both still developed by Data East.[CR]Pony Canyon / Scitron released a limited-edition soundtrack album for this game (Wolf Fang, Tumble Pop - PCCB-00084) on March 21, 1992.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Bootlegs don't use the HuC6280 @ 4.0275 Mhz :-)[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]To eliminate an enemy, the simple way is to catch him with the vacuum cleaner, and then throw him away before he gets out by himself and kills you. You can also throw an enemy against other one, and especially catch more enemies at a time, in order to create a real "avalanche" that will run over the others. The basic strategy for every scheme is to catch as many enemies as possible, and then throw them against the other enemies, so you can clean up the whole screen and accumulate many points.[CR]Every enemy killed will still release an item that gives you bonus points (coins, gems, diamonds, etc.).[CR]For catch an enemy, press the FIRE button and hold it while the enemy will be sucked inside the vacuum cleaner. However, there is a simple trick to catch them faster,  press the fire button ONCE against the enemy, or press the fire button and then turn back to him fast; the enemy will get dizzy for a few seconds. Now, just press again the fire button to immediately suck him inside the vacuum cleaner. Now keep the fire button pressed as long as you don't want to drop him. REMEMBER: You can't hold enemies in your vacuum cleaner for more than 4-5 seconds.[CR]The enemies generally walk around on the screen and jump to different platforms. Especially, there are some kinds of enemies that can turn themselves into a type of tornado before going up or down to the next platform; in this moment these enemies are invincible, you can't catch them and also the 'tornado form' will block eventually enemies that you've thrown against them.[CR]When you fight a boss, you must defeat him by catching the weapons or enemies that he will drop and then throw these against him. If you catch more than three enemies, you'll give more damage to the boss.[CR]In some levels, there are some types of jars, that will release constantly new enemies. The form of these jars changes with the stage's background, but despite this these are all identical to each other. You need to hit these jars throwing enemies against them for two or three times to destroy them. After being destroyed, the jars will release some gems. Sometimes there are two jars in the same level.[CR]You can catch enemies even through walls. This is a great advantage to you, especially against those enemies that can shoot from far distances or when you're near too busy platforms.[CR]There are several bonus items and power ups hidden all over the screen. At the beginning those are not visible; you must first catch some enemies and then throw them in the open space of the level, and especially near the corner where the power-ups are often frequent.[CR]Dropping a single enemy is not effective to discover all the bonuses of a level: the best way is to catch three or more enemies and then throw them in an empty space, which makes them roll over the whole screen and then revealing the bonuses.[CR]The power ups are generally placed in the various corners at the left or right of the screen, and occasionally in the central platforms of the screen. Keep this in mind if you are actually looking for a power up.[CR]There are several power ups :[CR]"Skate" : make the player's character movements faster.[CR]"Star" : Give to the player a barrier that makes him invincible for some time and kill enemies by simple contact.[CR]"Laser Pistol" : Turn your vacuum cleaner in a laser pistol, that kills all the enemies and jars instantly.[CR]"Package ?" : This will recall a large vacuum cleaner above the screen that will clean up the whole screen of every enemy and bonus item: however, the points for the bonus and enemies are still added to the player's score, but you'll not take the benefit of the power ups.[CR]"Tumblepop's Guy" : this is the classical 1UP item, which gives you an extra life. Only available in the bonus stage.[CR]Special letters : these are special items that will appear on screen like the other bonus items. At the bottom of the screen there is the word TUMBLE POP written with the letters placed inside blue balls. You must collect the letters that make the word TUMBLE POP. Once you've completed it, you'll be teleported into a bonus stage where you can collect any type of money and gems and an extra life, before time runs out. If you made it to collect all the items, the time left will become bonus points. After the bonus stage is completed, you'll be teleported into the next level. There are some letters that don't belong to the word TUMBLE POP, which only count as extra points.[CR]In the final stage, before you fight against the final boss (Mad Doctor), you'll fight against the previous bosses. This is the only time that you can find power ups in a boss fight.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Planner : Makoto Kikuchi[CR]Programmers : Hidemi Hamada, Kei Ichikawa, M.

Upon entering the magical forest, the young girl is changed into a crystal ball by evil warlock and ruler of the forest, 'Wardner'. She is taken to a secret place deep inside the woods. The brave young Pyros, armed only with a magical flame as a weapon, sets out to rescue his female companion from the clutches of the evil Wardner and bring her safely home.[CR]At the end of every level, Pyros enters a shop. The player can use any gold that has been collected on route to buy useful items; such as extra health, time and more powerful weapons.

Most stages include a boss, that once defeated leaves behind a key to the next stage.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID: 317-0043[CR]Runs on the Sega "System 2" hardware.[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (STAB, JUMP)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Wonder Boy in Monster Land was released in August 1987 in Japan. It was developed by Westone.[CR]A bootleg of this game was made by Galaxy Electronics in England.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* This game has hidden coins that appear when you jump in certain spots. The demo screen shows a couple of these. Some of them will give you 60 gold or more every time.[CR]* How to get 60+ golds from hidden coins : Besides the general strategy of quickly wiggling the joystick right and left while jumping (which raises the chance to get 60+ golds), certain coins, in certain places within the game, will ALWAYS yield 60+ golds if you perform particular actions :[CR]1) Round 2 : On the screen after you kill the Vampire, there's a platform with a Shoe Shop and some stairs which lead downwards to an Infirmary. Wait for the little mushroom to go down the stairs, and stand so that you are almost off the topmost stair. The mushroom will come back up and hit you, making you fall off the stairs. Hold the joystick to the left so that when you land you walk into the bottom step. This will drop a 60+ coin. NOTE: This trick only works if you haven't bought any shoes yet.[CR]2) Round 3 : On the stage after you kill the Red Knight, you'll see some jellyfishes on platforms over the water. At the first jellyfish you come to, wait for it to drop into the water, then lean out of the platform putting yourself on its trajectory. The jellyfish will hit you, and you'll get a 60+ golds bag. NOTE: This trick is shown during the attract mode.[CR]3) Round 3 (Baraboro) : Climb the ladder to the platform where the Shield Shop and Catherine's window are located. Once you're atop the ladder, let the mouse hit you. You'll fall leftwards, triggering a 60+ golds bag.[CR]4) Round 6 (Pyramid) : Beneath the platform where the Infirmary is located, there are some spikes. Approach the spikes as much as possible, then hit jump and fire at the same time, and keep hitting them every time you land. Some coins will start to fall from the platform and head towards you. If you'll keep a pace as much regular as possible, many of those coins will yield 60+ golds.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Wonder Boy [Model 315-5135] (1986, Arcade)[CR]2.

				<plot>2020 Super Baseball (c) 1991 SNK.[CR]There is no longer conventional baseball in 2020. The Super Baseball designed by the SUPER BASEBALL ASSOCIATION has been very popular and is the best sport. However, the truth is that the association has used a colossal sum of money to promote Super Baseball as show business. They have manipulated each player's ability using the control computer to secretly decide victory or defeat in every game. The players who knew this removed the connecting parts of the computer to play their own game of baseball.[CR]Finally, a fair game in going to be played at "CYBER EGG"![CR]FUTURISTIC SUPER BASEBALL, NOW PLAY BALL![CR]2020 Super Baseball:[CR]1. Futuristic Graphics[CR]2. Select 1 of 12 individual teams of men, women &amp; robot players.[CR]3. Fast paced game with new rules![CR]4. You can make your team stronger with prizes earned from amazing catches.[CR]5. 2 players simultaneous competition with CONTINUE mode.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-030[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 players - 4 buttons per player.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]2020 Super Baseball was released on September 20, 1991 in Japan.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* How to Play:[CR]Hitting : [CR][A] Swing/Return to base[CR][B] Stolen Base/Lead off[CR][C] Bunt[CR][D] Time Out[CR]Fielding : [CR][A] Pitch/Throw ball/Jump[CR][B] Base touch/Feint ball[CR][C] x[CR][D] Time out[CR]* There is no infield fly rule in this game, which can be used to the advantage of a defender if there are base runners. Double plays and even triple plays are common because of this.[CR]* A base runner cannot begin to steal bases until the pitcher has released the ball. In most baseball video games and in real life, a runner can begin to steal the next base at any time. However, stealing a base beforehand can only be done if you continuously press the steal button right after the screen cuts-back after the batter hit a foul ball, and the pitcher will not even notice you running.[CR]* The 3rd baseman, 2nd baseman, and 1st baseman will not leave the base to retrieve a ball. They will instead stand on the base and wait for another fielder to get the ball, which can sometimes mean they will stand there while the ball rolls inches away from them. The only exception would be if the shortstop covers third or second base for the fielder; then they remain in the stationary position.[CR]* Since the game has semi-automatic fielding, you cannot change which defensive player you want to run after the ball, which means sometimes the pitcher will end up chasing a ball well into the outfield.[CR]* If a ball is hit far enough into the stands, it can sometimes become stuck, allowing the batter to garnish an in the park home run. Because of the reduced home run zone, faster players can often round the bases by hitting the ball up into the fair-zone stands.[CR]* The computer players will always attempt to hit the ball straight, as if trying to hit a home run, no matter what the strength of the batter. This can sometimes give an unfair advantage to you, since they do not try to pull the ball just barely fair in order to get a hit. This has its downfall, in that some powerful players will hit home runs easily.[CR]* You cannot play against a team from the other league.[CR]* If you manage to score more than 100 runs, your score will turn back to zero, as there are only two spaces for your runs. Consequently, if you score 101 runs, and your opponent scores two runs, you will lose the game 01-02.[CR]* You cannot change players positions in the field or line up without replacing them.[CR]* If another player is in your line of path to throw the ball, they will catch the ball after you throw it. This means that if the shortstop retrieves a ground ball just behind 3rd base, then the throw will get cut-off by the 3rd baseman and then the pitcher before the ball gets to 1st base. The pitcher will almost always get in the way, and this can present a problem when trying to pull a double play between third and first or second and home.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Developed by Pallas.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR][JP] SNK Neo-Geo (1991) "2020 Super Baseball [Model NGH-030]"[CR][JP] Nintendo Super Famicom (1993) "2020 Toshi no Super Baseball [Model SHVC-SA]"[CR][JP] Sega Mega Drive (1994) "2020 Toshi Super Baseball [Model EM20027]"[CR][JP] SNK Neo-Geo CD (1995) "2020 Super Baseball [Model NGCD-030]"[CR]</plot>

This trick is best done here.[CR]2) Collect negative points to roll your score back under zero. You will be granted massive time on the massive points you have. Unfortunately, time will be taken off at an incredible rate.[CR]3) Run over the negative points flag as necessary to get rid of the points you win just by moving forward and crashing into the nearby trees.[CR]4) Repeat Step 4 until you've run out of time. You now have a completely unbeatable high-score which (if it were 1981) people would beg you to tell them how you did it.[CR]WARNING : ABSOLUTELY, POSITIVELY DON'T GO BACK ACROSS ZERO OR YOUR GAME WILL END IMMEDIATELY!!![CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles : [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [JP] (July 28, 2005) "Taito Memories Joukan [Model SLPM-66057]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [AU] (March 30, 2006) "Taito Legends 2 [Model SLES-53852]" [CR]Microsoft XBOX [EU] (March 31, 2006) "Taito Legends 2" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [EU] (March 31, 2006) "Taito Legends 2 [Model SLES-53852]" [CR]Sony PlayStation 2 [US] (May 16, 2007) "Taito Legends 2 [Model SLUS-21349]" [CR]* Handhelds : [CR]Sony PSP [AS] (January 3, 2006) "Taito Memories Pocket [Model UCAS-40040]" [CR]Sony PSP [JP] (January 5, 2006) "Taito Memories Pocket [Model ULJM-05076]" [CR]Sony PSP [KO] (February 10, 2006) "Taito Memories Pocket" [CR]Sony PSP [EU] (October 6, 2006) "Taito Legends Power-Up [Model ULES-00473]" [CR]Sony PSP [AU] (November 9, 2006) "Taito Legends Power-Up [Model ULES-00473]" [CR]Sony PSP [US] (May 17, 2007) "Taito Legends Power-Up [Model ULUS-10208]" [CR]* Computers : [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [EU] (March 31, 2006) "Taito Legends 2" [CR]PC [MS Windows, CD-ROM] [US] (July 10, 2007) "Taito Legends 2"[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Arch Rivals (c) 1989 Bally Midway Mfg. Co. [CR]Arch Rivals is a hilarious basketball game featuring customizing team names and colors. A full game consists of four quarters, with four minutes each. Each team has two players, and the objective of the game is to outscore the opponent until the final buzzer sounds. [CR]If the game results in a tie after four quarters, a sudden death overtime period is added, in which case the next basket to go in will win the game for the team who scored it. The overtime period is one minute long. A player can call for his teammate to pass him the ball or to shoot it.

				<plot>Hyper Athlete (c) 1996 Konami.[CR]A superb 3-D update of Konami's Track and Field series, in which up to 4 players compete in 11 different Olympic events. All 6 events from the legendary first game, 1983's "Track and Field", are included; but tellingly, only 3 events (swimming, pole vault and triple jump) are taken from the less accomplished sequel, Hyper Sports. Hyper Athlete uses the three-button control system of its predecessors (two RUN buttons and one ACTION button per player) and the 11 disciplines can be attempted in any order. The available events are :[CR]* 100M DASH - Use the RUN buttons to run as fast as possible.[CR]* LONG JUMP - Run to the take-off board then press and hold the ACTION button until you achieve the desired angle of jump (45 is optimal).[CR]* FREESTYLE SWIMMING - Another straightforward "sprint" event, the only difference being that as you approach the end of you first length of the pool, press the ACTION button to 'flip' your swimmer and begin the return length.[CR]* 110M HURDLES - Run and time jumps over the hurdles. the optimum jumping point is around the halfway point between the hurdles.[CR]* HAMMER THROW - Gradually build up the power meter, the athlete will do three build-up spins followed by three full-speed spins; on the third full spin, hold and release the ACTION button to achieve the desired angle of throw (45 is optimal).[CR]* DISCUS - Similar to the Hammer Throw, only this time, instead of gradually charging up the power meter, try for full power from the start. You must release the discus on the second spin. Be aware that on this event, the angle meter increases much faster than in other events.[CR]* SHOT PUT - Start charging up the power meter and your character will bow down and lift his leg. As he begins to turn, hold the ACTION and release once the desired angle is achieved (45 is optimal).[CR]* HIGH JUMP - Run to the bar as quickly as possible. When you reach it, a "Jump" caption appears; immediately press ACTION button to start the jump. The longer the button is held down, the less steep the angle of your jump, i.e. just tapping the button would generate a jump of 90 degrees.[CR]* JAVELIN - Run to the line as quickly as possible, then press and hold ACTION, releasing to chose the desired angle of throw (50 is optimal).[CR]* TRIPLE JUMP - Press RUN (LEFT and RIGHT) buttons repeatedly to gain speed, then hold ACTION to initiate the first jump. It should be noted that for the first two jumps, the angle meter does not appear. The player should hold the button down for about .5 of a second before releasing. When you land you will take one step forward, press ACTION only when you have taken a step to instigate the second jump. The angle meter comes into play on the third and final jump, and the desired angle is 45 degrees.[CR]* POLE VAULT - This is by far the trickiest event of the game. Press the RUN buttons to start the run-up. Then, as you near the silver pole trap, hold ACTION and the pole will lower towards the trap (the closer it is, the more power you will have for the next part). Keep holding ACTION until you reach the top of the bar, then release. You will then let go of the pole and vault over.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Konami GV System hardware[CR]Game ID : GV021[CR]Main CPU : PSX (@ 16.9344 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : SPU (@ 16.9344 Mhz), CD/DA (@ 16.9344 Mhz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Hyper Athlete was released in June 1996 in Japan only.[CR]Hyper Athlete is actually an optimized version of the Sony PlayStation game, "Hyper Olympics in Atlanta [Model SLPM-86002]", also by Konami.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>League Bowling (c) 1990 SNK [Shin Nihon Kikaku].[CR]A colourful and playable ten-pin bowling game for 1 to 4 players, offering a choice of three scoring methods : 'Regulation', 'Flash' and 'Strike 90'.[CR]The game begins with players selecting either a right or left-handed bowler, before choosing what weight they want their bowling balls to be. Once the match starts properly, Power and Direction meters will appear and players must use both their judgement and timing to select and execute the desired bowl. Timing is key as players are only allowed twenty seconds to make each shot.[CR]The 'Strike 90' mode awards players ninety points for a strike and sixty points for a spare. In the 'Flash' game mode, the points flash across the lane as the players throw the ball. Should they succeed in knocking down the standing pins, the points that are displayed at the time the pins are struck will be added to the players' scores.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : NGM-019[CR][SNK MVS Neo-Geo Controls][CR]2 Players - 4 Buttons Per Player (only 1 usable).[CR][Joystick] 8-Way, [A] Set Controls/Set Power[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]League Bowling was released on December 10, 1990.[CR]Nadia from Secret of Blue Water make a cameo in this game.

				<plot>NBA Jam (c) 1993 Midway Mfg. Co.[CR]Two-on-two basketball with digitized images of real NBA players, monster dunks and no referee - it's a blowout![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Midway T Unit hardware[CR]Main CPU : TMS34010 (@ 6.25 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.57958 Mhz), DAC, OKI6295 (@ 8 Khz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Released in February 1993. Many critics claim that the release of NBA Jam gave rise to a new genre of sports games, which were based around action-packed, unrealistic game-play.[CR]Midway Games, no stranger to releasing landmark games having released "Pac-Man", had started experimenting with the ideas two years earlier, with the "High Impact Football" series. Both High Impact and Super High Impact had somewhat average success in arcades. It was not until the release of NBA Jam that gamers noticed the new genre. The game became exceptionally popular, and generated a lot of money for arcades after its release, largely because of the fairly expensive prices put on these games; a game quarter generally took two credits and a full game generally took eight, typically equal to $2.00 USD. Nonetheless, the game was a smash hit.[CR]NBA Jam was one of the first real playable basketball arcade games (It was the first game to be officially licensed by the NBA (National Basketball Association)), and was also one of the first sports games to feature real teams, real players, and their real digitized likenesses. However, the unrealism of the game was the major drawing point, as the high flying dunks (often featuring players jumping twice their own height in the air while making highly acrobatic slams) were the games' signature. Of course, seeing NBA superstars like Hakeem Olajuwon, Karl Malone, David Robinson, Charles Barkley, and Shaquille O'Neal flying through the air with the greatest of ease brought just as many fans back. In time, players discovered another major feature of the game, as it was filled with easter eggs, special features and players activated by initials or button/joystick combinations.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Revision 1[CR]* Software version : 2.00.[CR]Revision 2 :[CR]* Software version 3.01.[CR]* Credit problems fixed.[CR]* Jersey color of special guests fixed.[CR]* Prevents games from ending at the Tank mini-game.[CR]* Added 'Fair Shake'.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hidden Characters :[CR]Air Morris - WIL, Jan 1[CR]Carleton - JMC, Aug 5[CR]Divita - SAL, Feb 1 (Sal Divita did the artwork for NBA Jam, as well as some graphics work on Mortal Kombat)[CR]Goskie - TWG, Dec 7[CR]Hey - JWH, Sep 20 (On the design team screen, Jon Hey is the one in the checkered shirt and glasses, sticking his tongue out to the rest of the world)[CR]Howard - HOW, Jul 15[CR]Liptak - SL(space), Jun 24 (Shawn Liptak is the one on the design team screen with a basketball for a brain)[CR]Newcomer - JRN, Jun 18[CR]Oursler - SNO, Jan 3[CR]Petro - GNP, Oct 8 (George N.

It features the voice of the legendary NHL announcer Pat Foley. Over 100 real players, each player's skill level reflects his real NHL ability. This is the only NHL game that has had the rights to have both of hockey's greatest, Wayne Gretzky &amp; Gordie Howe (hidden player) in the same game.[CR]During the match, you can see in the background an advert for Kellogg's Corn Pops.[CR]The flyer of this game has a photograph of the Chicago Blackhawks goaltender Eddie 'The Eagle' Belfour on it. The text refers to a '140mph' slapshot -- The individual who wrote this seems to have forgotten to do the metric conversion from kilometers per hour. He/she should have written 140 km/h (or 90 mph) as that's more realistic.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Hidden Characters (Initials, Birth-date) :[CR]Al Lasko - AL(space), Aug 31[CR]Andy Lycke - AL(space), Nov 23[CR]Art Tianis - AJT, Oct 23[CR]Bill Dabelstein - DOZ, Dec 31[CR]Brian Eddie - BRE, Apr 20[CR]Bridgitte Fedesna - BMF, May 09[CR]Carlos Pesina - CCP, Nov 15[CR]Cary Mednick - CMM, Jul 02[CR]Chris Bobrowski - ME(space), May 12[CR]Christa Woss - CLW, Jul 09[CR]Craig Janney - C(space)J, Sept 26[CR]Dan Thompson - DJT, Jun 04[CR]Dave Michicich - DLM, Aug 06[CR]Dave Zab - ZAB, May 28[CR]Ed Boon - EJB, Feb 22[CR]Ed Keenan - EJK, Apr 10[CR]Eddie Ferrier - EF(space), Jun 10[CR]Eugeene Geer - OEG, Nov 05[CR]Eugene Jarvis - EPJ, Jan 27[CR]Evil Haeger - JH(space), Jul 13[CR]Glenn Shipp - GWS, Jun 11[CR]Gordie Howe - G(space)H, Mar 31[CR]Heather Beach - HAB, Mar 24[CR]Jack H.

Hold down the Turbo button and direction yourself at the quarterback before the ball is even snapped. On virtually every single play, you'll blast through the line and nail the quarterback before he can even move regardless of whether or not the play is a run or pass, simply because the offensive line never bothers to block you when this trick is performed.[CR]* Easily block kicks : When the computer is going for a field goal or extra point, take control of one of the defensive players all the way in the back of the field goal block formation. When the ball is snapped, run at the long snapper, then turbo at the kicker and jump. The glitch comes in the form of the long snapper never bothering to try blocking you, and you'll be able to block virtually any kick with ease.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Track &amp; Field (c) 1983 Konami.[CR]Track &amp; Field is a multi-event sports game. Up to four players compete against each other in six track and field events in this legendary, genre creating and much-copied game from Konami. The game consists of two 'Run' buttons per player (one for each 'leg' of the athlete) and one action button.[CR]Only two players can compete simultaneously so on 3 and 4-player games, players have to wait their turn.[CR]An extra life is awarded for every 100000 points acquired.[CR]Each player must qualify in the current event before they can move on to the next.[CR]Hit the two 'Run' buttons to build up speed and use action button to jump or throw. [CR]The six events are : [CR]1) 100-meter Dash - Run as fast as possible. [CR]2) Long Jump - Run to the take-off board then choose angle of jump (42 is optimal). [CR]3) Javelin Throw - Run to the line then choose angle of throw (42 is optimal). [CR]4) 110-meter Hurdles - Run and time jumps over the hurdles. [CR]5) Hammer Throw - As the athlete spins faster and faster, time release of hammer and angle of throw (45 is optimal). [CR]6) High Jump - The athlete will run to the bar, just as he reaches it, use Action button to start the jump and hold down the action button to reduce the angle of climb, i.e. you start going straight up at 90 degrees if you tap the button just once. Use run buttons while in the air to gain extra height.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : GX361 [CR]Main CPU : Motorola M6809 (@ 2.048 Mhz) [CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz) [CR]Sound Chips : DAC (@ 3.579545 Mhz), SN76496 (@ 1.789772 Mhz), Sanyo VLM5030 (@ 3.58 Mhz) [CR]Players : 4 [CR]Buttons : 3 [CR]= &gt; [1] Run (Left), [2] Jump/Throw, [3] Run (Right) [CR]Odd-numbered players (1 and 3) use the controls on the right side of the panel; even-numbered players (2 and 4) use the controls on the left side. [CR]In a 4-player game on an upright machine, players 1 and 3 share player 1's control; players 2 and 4 share player 2's control. [CR]On a cocktail machine, players 1 and 2 play from one end of the machine, while players 3 and 4 play from the opposite end. The screen's orientation will flip for each pair of players.[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Track &amp; Field was released in October 1983 by Konami. It was licensed to Centuri for US manufacture and distribution during the same month. [CR]Track &amp; Field proved to be incredibly successful for Konami, and would spawn countless imitations - particularly on the 8-bit home systems of the time - as well as three sequels of its own. One of the undoubted reasons for its success was the superb multi-player game, which, for perhaps the first time in the video arcade, introduced a genuine sense of rivalry among players and showed the gaming world what was truly possible with multi-player gaming. [CR]The song that is heard playing on the high score and awards screen is 'Chariots of Fire', written by Vangelis for the movie of the same name. [CR]This game is known in Japan as "Hyper Olympic". A Bootleg of this game called "Atlant Olimpic" was released in Italy in 1996, thirteen years after the game first appeared. [CR]A Track &amp; Field unit appears in the 1985 movie, 'The Goonies'.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]Later versions of this game replace the two 'Run' buttons with a trackball.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]Points are awarded in each event. The faster the time, the further or higher the jump, or the further you throw the more points you score.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* 100m Dash : Achieve exactly the same time for player 1 and 2 and 1000 point bonus will be awarded. [CR]* Long Jump : 3 jumps of exactly the same length will cause a little man with a key to run across the screen, awarding 1000 points. [CR]* Javelin : Throw the javelin off the top of the screen to bring down a bird for a 1000 point bonus. To do this you must achieve the 'maximum' angle. [CR]* 110m Hurdles : If both players finish the race in a dead heat then a little man with a key will run across the screen, awarding 1000 points to each player. [CR]* High Jump : Fail the first two jumps and then clear it; a mole burrows up for a 1000 point bonus. [CR]* Hint : When you alternate tapping the run buttons (run1, run2, run1, run2 etc.) you will get a much better speed increase. You have three attempts to qualify on all but the two running events. [CR]* BUG : In both Javelin and the Hammer Throw, throwing over 100m will cause a counter wraparound, so a 100m12 throw will be logged as 0m12 (and will not qualify you).[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

Four eighteen-hole golf courses are available: Germany, Japan, Australia and U.S.A. The two game modes on offer are one-player stroke play against the CPU, or stroke or match-play against a second player.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID : 0200[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 4 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2610 (@ 8 Mhz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR]=&gt; [A] Power then Height and shot, [B] Hook, [C] Slice[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Big Tournament Golf was released in January 1996 in Japan.[CR]This game is known outside Japan as Neo Turf Masters.[CR]This is the first Nazca game written for the Neo-Geo MVS.

If the ball gets closer to the pin than the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.[CR]2) The longest driving contest : you have to shoot the ball as far as possible in one hit. If you exceed the previous record, you will earn a bonus hole.[CR]* The order from the best to the worst performance is :[CR]Albatros (3 hits less than for a Par)[CR]Eagle (2 hits less than for a Par)[CR]Birdie (1 hit less than for a Par)[CR]Par (the average level)[CR]Bogey (1 hit more than for a Par)[CR]Double Bogey (2 hits more than for a Par)[CR]Triple Bogey (3 hits more than for a Par)[CR]If you miss the attempt to make a Triple Bogey, you will have to give up the hole and will suffer an additional penalty.[CR]If the ball arrives out of bound or in the water, you will be penalized one stroke.[CR]* You CAN apply spin to the ball, forward or back. Neo Turf Masters requires two taps on the keypad to strike the ball. The first tap determines power, the second tap determines loft. After the first tap and before the second, push up or down on the joystick. You can get a wicked backspin on the ball. You can also forward spin through the wind, or land short and roll nicely up a hill.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Neo Turf Masters (1996)[CR]2.

The graphic's quality and the extremely good gameplay pushed "Ultimate Tennis" to the 2nd place in Germany and  to the 14th place in the Japanese charts and was successfully diffused all around the world : 5.000 boards have been sold worldwide and among them more than 500 boards in Japan![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12.5 Mhz), TMS34010 (@ 5 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : OKI6295 (@ 8.08 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 3[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Even if titlescreen says 1993, Ultimate Tennis was released in January 1994.[CR]Art and Magic was founded in 1992 by Yves Grolet and Franck Sauer, respectively the coder and the graphics artist behind some of the most technically advanced Amiga titles of all time : UNREAL by Ubi Soft (1990) and AGONY by Psygnosis (1992) which is also the first title published under the Art and Magic logo.[CR]Yves Grolet started his career on the Commodore 64 in 1986 at only 19 developing 2 titles: the graphical adventure NO published by Lankhor and the conversion of Iron Lord by Ubi Soft.[CR]After Art and Magic Yves founded the PC adventure games developer Appeal S.A. in 1995 and released OUTCAST after 4 years of work, and in 2002 he became CEO of elseWhere entertainment.[CR]Ultimate Tennis was their first arcade game, as they were still trying to adapt to their new platform, digitised sprites (all palette swaps of the same footage) were used as a proof of concept - later the artists would develop their caricature style to make cel-animated sprites. Approximately 5,000 units were produced.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Artwork : Franck Sauer, Iwan Scheer[CR]Software : Yann Robert, Yves Grolet[CR]Music : Franck Sauer, Christian Dutilleux[CR]Starring : Eric Dardenne[CR]Hardware designer : Deltatec[CR]Manufacturing : Deltatec[CR]</plot>

				<plot>U.S.Championship Beach Volley - V'Ball (c) 1988 Technos Japan Corp.[CR]The player takes control of a pair of beach bums named George and Michael who make their living playing beach volleyball against locals. One day, they find a flyer for a nationwide beach volleyball tournament offering the winning team a $2,500,000 cash prize.[CR]In single-player mode, one person controls both characters on a team. In two-player mode, the players either cooperate by playing on the same team or compete against each other by controlling opposing teams. The American version allows the game to be played by up to four players (if the cabinet allows it). The single-player mode consists of two cycles with four stages: the Minor Circuit and the Major Circuit. The stages in the game are Daytona Beach, New York, Los Angeles and Hawaii. After completing the Major Circuit, the player faces against the U.S. Navy team, set in a naval base.[CR]The controls consist of an eight directional joystick and two buttons for jumping and receiving. The characters perform several moves including power spiking, back spiking, jump-serving, blocking and diving.[CR]There are a few minor differences between the Japanese and American releases. The Japanese release features an opening cut-scene explaining the plot. Between matches, intermission sequences depict the main characters visiting a car dealership to purchase a vehicle. As the player progresses, the cars increase in quality, shifting from used cars to new cars during the Major Circuit. The American release removes these cut-scenes, but extends the multiplayer support to up to four players with multiple game modes: 1 or 2 players against the computer, 1-on-1, 2-on-1, or 2-on-2.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : TA-0025[CR]Main CPU : MOS Technology M6502 (@ 2 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 8 Khz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]U.S.Championship Beach Volley was released in December 1988.[CR]V'Ball stands for 'VolleyBall'.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Nintendo Famicom (1989, US : "Super Spike V'Ball", Japan : "US Championship V'Ball")[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Water Ski (c) 1983 Taito Corp.[CR]In this timed abstract racing game, a single player controls a water-skier who is being pulled along behind a power-boat. The objective is to complete the course in as fast a time as possible to reach the next course, while avoiding rocks, sharks, motor boats, wind surfers and numerous other obstacles.[CR]The player can move their skier left or right, and can press buttons to either slow the boat's speed or to jump over obstacles. Small rocks are the most common obstacle and can either be avoided or jumped over. As well as the small rocks that litter each course, there are also occasional large rocks; these cannot be jumped and must be avoided at all costs. Also, players must be watchful of the direction their tow-boat takes them otherwise they risk being dragged into oncoming obstacles or having their tow-rope snapped on one of the large rocks.[CR]As well as obstacles, each stage also contains one or more large jump ramps. To make a successful jump, players must ensure they hit the bottom of the ramp with their ski-board facing directly forwards. At the top of the ramp players must press the JUMP button, which will propel them from the end of the ramp to make a perfect landing in the water below. Making a successful ramp jump awards the player with bonus points, but if a player fails to hit the bottom of the ramp properly, they will crash and lose valuable seconds.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]It came in the standard 'Taito Classic' cabinet (the same one that was used for titles such as "Qix", "Zoo Keeper", and "Jungle King").

He began playing organized hockey at the age of 6 and by 10 he scored 378 goals and 139 assists in just 85 games with the Nadrofsky Steelers. He entered the WHA (World Hockey Association) on June 12, 1978 and the NHL the following year.

He was also the first player to score over 200 points in a season, a feat he accomplished 4 times. Gretzky retired from hockey in 1999. In his last game playing for the New York Rangers against the Pittsburgh Penguins on April 29, 1999, he recorded his 2857th point in his 1487th game and retired with 894 goals and 1963 assists. He is the first and only NHL player to have his jersey number (99) retired league-wide, meaning no player will ever again wear the number 99 again.[CR][B]Staff[/B][CR]Programmers : Steve Bennetts, Terry Farnham, Steve Thomas[CR]Artists : Bob Ingold, Jeremy Mattson, Patrice Moriarity[CR]Producer : Robert Daly[CR]Associate producer : Howard Lehr[CR]Marketing manager : Derryl Depriest[CR]Technician : Dennis Nale[CR]Audio : John Paul, Doug Brandon, Jon Hey[CR]Hardware designers : Steve Correll, Andrew Dyer, Ross Shaffer, Ray Macika, John Lowes[CR]Game testers : Rob Reininger, David Ortiz, Trenton Lewis, Todd Papy, Jesse Meza[CR]Hardware support : Steve Norris, Don Thomas, Jeff Peters, Pat Cox, Betty Purcell, Sam DeVaney, Bobby Kay, Scott Parrish, Gregg Piotrowski, Al Lasko, Sheridan Oursler, Leroy Brown, Rick Meyette[CR]DCS2 sound system : Matt Booty, Ed Keenan[CR]Support programmers : Bruce Rogers, David Shepperd, Robert Birmingham, Mike Albaugh, Mike Lynch, Jason Skiles, Chris Krubel, Forrest Miller[CR]Executive producer : Mark Stepen Pierce[CR]Publicist : Tracy Egan[CR]Additional technicians : Mark Hoendervoogt, Minh Nguyen, Todd Modjeski, Pete Mokris[CR]Mechanical engineers : Mark Gruber, Ralph Perez, Ted Valavanis, Tom Sedor, Chris Bobrowski[CR]Development hardware engineers : Alan Gray, John Moore, Sam Lee, Senthil Vinayagam, Mark Hess[CR]Sr. Engineering Tech. : Patrick Hubbell[CR]Cabinet designers : Nik Ehrlich, Rudy Aguire, Joyce Fluty, Mark Gruber, Pete Takaichi[CR]Motion capture models : Wayne Gretzky, Eddie Mio, Charlie Simmons, Howard Lehr, Steve Thomas, Robert Daly[CR]Video production : Joe Noyes, Greg Allen, Brent Englund, Eric Durfey[CR]Statistics : George Zeimek, Robert Daly[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Nintendo 64 (1996) : features Arcade and Simulation modes.[CR]</plot>

World Rally is a 1- or 2-player alternating driving game. Controls include a steering wheel on a mounting pod, a high/low gear shifter assembly, and an accelerator pedal.[CR]Players select 1 of 4 rallies to start, each progressively more difficult than the one before. A rally is composed of three stages, offering a variety of different track layouts and road surfaces. Asphalt, dirt, night driving and snow-covered roads require players to adjust their driving skills accordingly.[CR]Players maneuver their way through hairpin curves, jumps, bridges, puddles, and other obstacles. Completing each stage within the 60-second time limit allows players to advance to the next stage for free. After the finish of each stage, and at the completion of all 12 stages, players' times are displayed and compared with other top drivers.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 930705[CR]Main CPU : DS5002FP (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : OKI6295 (@ 1 MHz)[CR]Screen orientation : Horizontal[CR]Video resolution : 368 x 232 pixels[CR]Screen refresh : 60.00 Hz[CR]Palette colors : 8192[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Licensed to Atari for US distribution.

				<plot>WWF WrestleFest (c) 1991 Technos Japan Corporation.[CR]10 selectable wrestlers fight in a tag team tournament or take part in the Royal Rumble.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : TA-0031[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 12 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 7.759 Khz)[CR]Players : 4[CR]Control : 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 [CR]=&gt; Punch, Kick[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]WWF Wrestlefest was released in July 1991.[CR]Also licensed to Tecmo.[CR]The only WWF Technos game to not feature theme music for any of the individual wrestlers.[CR]The announcer is Michelle 'Mike' McGuirk, who would sometimes substitute for Howard Finkel, the WWF's longtime ring announcer. McGuirk worked as a ring announcer for the WWF between 1988 and 1993 before she left because, according to her, she refused sexual advances made upon her by WWF owner Vince McMahon.[CR]The game's announcer incorrectly announces Sergeant Slaughter's finishing move. Slaughter's finishing move (digging a knuckle into the opponent's temple) is announced as a 'Cobra Clutch', whereas that move is called 'The Torture Bar'. A Cobra Clutch looks totally different : DiBiase's Million Dollar Dream is a Cobra Clutch.[CR]You can beat the Legion of Doom and get their titles via a count-out in the Tag Team portion of the game (Saturday Night's Main Event). This is incorrect : in pro wrestling, a championship only changes hands via a pinfall or a submission. If the champion/champions are counted-out or are disqualified, they lose the match, but they hold on to their titles.[CR]The rules for the Royal Rumble are not quite correct. In WrestleFest, you can be eliminated by being thrown from the ring, or the traditional means (pin, submission, etc.). This is not correct. Ever since the WWF Royal Rumble started, the rules for elimination have never changed. The ONLY way to be eliminated is to be thrown over the top rope. No pinfalls, no submissions. In fact, the referee should not be in the ring during a Royal Rumble as he remains on the outside of the ring to confirm elimination has occurred.[CR]Although the rules for the steel cage match has changed over the years, the Steel Cage Matches in WrestleFest are not done correctly, by pro wrestling rules at the time of release. Again, there should not be a referee in the ring and pinfalls or submissions do not count. To win a steel cage match, you must be the first to escape the steel cage... either by breaking the door open and crawling out, or by climbing over the top (in both cases you win when your feet touch the ground first outside the ring). In the present day however, pinfalls do count and a referee is present although you still can win by escaping the cage.[CR]Crush and Smash are not the original members of Demolition. Crush joined the team in 1990 when Ax (Bill Eadie) suffered from ill health caused by an allergic reaction to shellfish and the WWF wanted to 'hide' his illness on television by adding a third member to the team to make them look stronger. This game was made just as Crush replaced him, but at the time of actual release, Demolition had already broken up. Smash was repackaged as The Repo Man while Crush turned face (good guy) and the 2 feuded for a while.[CR]Crush and Smash may not be played separately in the tag-team (Saturday Night's Main Event) game.

				<plot>Block Out (c) 1989 Technos Japan Corp.[CR]Block Out is a 1-player or a simultaneous 2 players competitive game of unique dimensional action and strategy.[CR]As the blocks drop one-by-one into the three-dimensional pit, rotate them by using the three buttons and joystick. Once the player has decided on the the rotation of the block, use the button to drop the block into place. The objective is to place the blocks into the pit without leaving any empty spaces. Once this is achieved, the layers without empty spaces, will disappear.[CR]The player begins the game by selecting a starting stage. Game start level select can be chosen from stages 1, 5, 10, 15, or 20. There is a total of 100 stages in the game and as the players progress through the game, the stages get more and more difficult.[CR]Each stage has a certain number of layers (faces) that must be erased. Once these faces are erased, the player will move on to the next stage. The less blocks the players has left in the pit at the end of the stage, the more points are awarded.[CR]In addition to the one player mode, Block Out offers a competitive simultaneous two player mode. The split screen effect gives each player their own pit with which to play in. They compete against each other in the race to erase the faces. As one player erases a face, that face will be added to the opponent's pit, making their pit rise. This allows less room to work. There are two ways to win in the 2-player mode :[CR]1) Force the opponent to the top of their pit and out of the game[CR]or[CR]2) Erase 21 faces first.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : TA-0029[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 10 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : Zilog Z80 (@ 3.579545 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : Yamaha YM2151 (@ 3.579545 Mhz), OKI6295 (@ 8 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 4[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Developed by California Dreams.[CR]Released in October 1989.[CR]The name 'Block Out' is actually a trademark of Kadon Enterprises.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]If the player can erase all of the blocks in the pit, this will make a 'block out'.

				<title_clean>Puzzles - Columns</title_clean>
				<plot>Columns (c) 1990 Sega Enterprises, Limited. [CR]Sega's answer to the legendary "Tetris", the rules of Columns are simple : a column of 3 square pieces - stacked one on top of the other - drops from the top of the screen into the play area. As with Tetris, the column puzzle pieces can be moved left and right as they fall, but unlike Tetris, they cannot be rotated. Instead, pressing a button will cause the order of the colored blocks in a column to shift by one position.[CR]The object of the game is to place columns at the bottom of the pit in such a way that lines of 3 or more like-colored blocks are created (either horizontally, vertically or diagonally). When this happens, these blocks disappear, and any blocks resting upon them immediately fall onto the recently vacated space. This will often cause additional lines to be arranged, producing a 'cascade' effect. The key to a long game (and, ultimately, a high score) is to set up these cascades wherever possible.[CR]While not achieving the same legendary status as the mighty "Tetris" (something that no puzzle game can realistically hope to achieve), the 'Columns' series has managed to garner a dedicated following of its own and is a respected example of the genre.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs Sega "System C-2" hardware.[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 4-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 1 (Rotate)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Columns was released in March 1990.[CR]April Simmonds of Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada holds the official record for this game with 267,360 points on November 13, 2006.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The US version is slightly different :[CR]* 'Winners Don't Use Drugs' screen added.[CR]* Sega logo screen during the attract mode added.[CR]* Cocktail mode dip-switch.[CR]* Different music.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1.

				<plot>Klax (c) 1989 Atari Games.[CR]The tiles klank end over end down the ramp. Catch them on the paddle, or they fall in the pit. Flip them from the paddle into the bins, matching the same-colored tiles horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. Each line of colored tiles is a Klax. When you've made a Klax, you hear a fanfare. When you complete a wave, the crowd cheers. Let a tile fall in the pit, and you hear a scream as it falls in. If you fail to complete a wave, the crowd is disappointed. Stay alive, complete the waves and don't drop any tiles![CR]Catch the tiles as they come to the end of the ramp on the paddle. Flip a tile into a bin by pressing the start/flip button. Pull the joystick forward to increase the speed of the closest tile as it klanks down the ramp. Push the joystick back and toss the top tile on the paddle back on the ramp and gain a little time.[CR]The paddle can hold up to five tiles. As long as the green light is on below the paddle, you can pile more tiles on the paddle. When the red light appears, you must flip at least one tile in a bin or toss it back on the ramp before you can collect any more tiles. You can flip tiles into a bin as long as the green light is on below the bin.[CR]To succeed in Klax, make points and also complete each wave. Create a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row of at least three tiles (just like in tic-tac-toe) in the bins to make a Klax and make points. You receive the most points for diagonals, less for horizontals and the least for verticals. When you create a Klax, the tiles in the Klax disappear to make room for more tiles in the bins.[CR]Each wave has a different task to be completed, which is shown on the To Go Meter. This task could be making a certain number of Klaxes or points or surviving a certain number of tiles. Complete the task before too many tiles drop in the pit and you complete the wave. When you complete a wave, you receive bonus points for the tiles remaining on the ramp, on the paddle, and any empty spaces in the bins. If you fail, you can start again at the same wave.[CR]Klax does not have a clock for you to race against, but as your playing time increases, the tiles klank down the ramp faster and faster.[CR]Waves : When you first enter the game, you can start at wave 1, 6, or 11. Wave 1 teaches you how to play the game and use the controls. At every fifth wave you can choose to play the next wave, the fifth wave beyond, or the tenth wave beyond.[CR]Klax has five different types of waves and more than five different backgrounds. There are five waves per level, and one hundred waves to complete.[CR]Each time you begin a wave, the To Go meter shows what kind of Klaxes or how many points you need to accumulate to complete the wave. The different types of waves are :[CR]* Klaxes To Go, which are the easiest. Just create Klaxes horizontally, vertically or horizontally. Create enough Klaxes to complete the wave before you drop too many tiles in the pit.[CR]* Tiles To Go requires you to survive a certain number of tiles. Create Klaxes in any of the three ways to collect points and to clear the bins to hold more tiles.[CR]* Points To Go requires you to make a certain number of points. Create Klaxes to collect points but make diagonals, four- or five-of-a-kind Klaxes, and simultaneous Klaxes for higher points.[CR]* Diagonals To Go requires you to create diagonals. Create Klaxes in any way to collect points; but only the correct number of diagonals will complete the wave.[CR]* Horizontals To Go requires you to create horizontals. Only horizontal Klaxes will complete the wave; but you can create Klaxes vertically and diagonally to collect points.[CR]You see several kinds of information on the screen. These are the :[CR]* To Go Meter which continuously calculates the number of Klaxes, tiles, points, diagonals or horizontals still required to complete the wave. The number depends on the type of wave you are playing.[CR]* Drop Count, which shows the number of dropped tiles. The drop count is continuously calculated. When the number of tiles dropped is reached, the wave is over.[CR]* High Score, which shows the highest score to date, regardless of the number of continues that player had.[CR]* Wave Indicator, which shows what wave you are playing.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Game ID : 136075[CR]Main CPU : Motorola 68000 (@ 7.15909 Mhz)[CR]Sound Chips : OKI6295 (@ 6.779 Khz)[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 8-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 1[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Even if title screen says 1989, Klax was released in February 1990.[CR]550 dedicated upright were produced in the USA and 451 in Ireland for European distribution.

It was written in just a few weeks on "Escape From the Planet of the Robot Monsters" hardware.[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The prototype versions have different graphics, only one background with different palettes, and uglier tiles. Tiles sometimes look wrongly placed. When you throw the tile back, it's flying much further (approx. 6 seconds instead of 1).

You should be able to move a piece of track 3 or 4 times while your train is still on it, moving at normal speed.[CR]* If you have a long route opened up in front of you, run it at full speed, but remember it takes a couple of seconds at the end for your train to slow to its normal speed.[CR]* When your train is moving along a long route try to plan where it will go next by moving pieces your train has already passed over and maybe even swapping some of those around ahead of you to change your route.[CR][B]Game Ports[/B][CR]* Consoles :[CR]Mattel Intellivision (1982)[CR]Atari 2600 (1983)[CR]* Computers : [CR]Commodore C64 (1992)[CR]Tommy Tutor[CR]</plot>

				<plot>Magical Drop III (c) 1997 Data East.[CR]More characters, more gameplay modes, more frantic gameplay, more fun! This is what every videogame sequel should be, and the sequel to one of the best puzzle games for the Neo-Geo MVS is indeed a game not to be missed! Lots of fun for one or two players![CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Runs on the SNK "Neo-Geo MVS" hardware.[CR]Game ID: NGM-233[CR]Players: 2[CR]Control: 8-Way Joystick[CR]Buttons: 3[CR]=&gt; [A] Catch Balloons, [B] Throw Balloons, [C] Shift the balloons a line down[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Magical Drop III was released on February 25, 1997. This is Data East's final arcade video game. [CR]The game now features parodies of all the characters featured in the 22 cards of the major Arcana in a Tarot card deck. These are numbered from 0 to 21 as follows : [CR]00. Fool [CR]01. Magician [CR]02. High Priestess [CR]03. Emperor [CR]04. Empress [CR]05. Hierophant [CR]06. Lovers [CR]07. Chariot [CR]08. Strength [CR]09. Hermit [CR]10. (Wheel of) Fortune [CR]11. Justice [CR]12. Hanged Man [CR]13. Death [CR]14. Temperance [CR]15. Devil [CR]16. Tower [CR]17. Star [CR]18. Moon [CR]19. Sun [CR]20. Judgement [CR]21. World [CR]Note that the only exception to this statement would be Black Pierrot since he does not appear in a Tarot card deck. Black Pierrot is an added bonus character to challenge really good Magical Drop 3 pros! [CR]Note : In puzzle and adventure modes, only 8 characters are available : Fool, High Priestess, Emperor, Lovers, Chariot, Strength, Justice and Star. [CR]Default highscore table : [CR]Name Score Reactions Time [CR]1ST D.E 5000 8 06:00 [CR]2ND D.E 4500 7 05:30 [CR]3RD D.E 4000 6 05:00 [CR]4TH D.E 3500 5 04:30 [CR]5TH D.E 3000 4 04:00 [CR]Soundtrack releases (for limited edition): [CR]Magical Drop III - Pony Canyon / Scitron - PCCBX-00002 - March 21, 1997[CR][B]Updates[/B][CR]The Japanese version of this game features LOTS of stuff unavailable in any other version :[CR]* In Challenge Mode there is a story intro at the beginning explaining the reason behind the Magical Drop competition, an extra animation showing a close-up of the Magical Drop book as it opens,  an ending for each character available in the game, a "Hard" difficulty setting, as well as a bonus fortune reading when you beat the Challenge Mode or you lose against the CPU and  refuse to continue. All of this is absent in the USA &amp; Europe versions.[CR]* In Challenge Mode, each character has a unique set of quotes before a battle begins, this even applies in the battles against the end bosses Tower &amp; Fortune. In the USA &amp; Europe versions there are only two possible quotes before a fight for all characters :[CR]Quote #1[CR]CPU : Get out of my way![CR]Player : I'll never lose to you! [CR]Quote #2[CR]CPU : You want to fight?[CR]Player : Now let's see who is better![CR]* In Adventure mode, each character has its very own story intro as well as its very own ending which is different from the one seen in Challenge mode. Additionally this mode plays like a board game in which you compete against three other characters on the board, and if any of the others get to Empress' castle before your character, you will get a generic bad ending. If you arrive on a tile already occupied by a CPU-controlled character, you will have 2 options :[CR]1) The option on the right : you don't want to trouble and ignore the opponent (sometimes you will have to back off 1 tile)[CR]2) The option on the left : you fight the opponent. If you win, he or she will be eliminated but it would be the same for you if you fail, so be careful![CR]In the USA and European versions, there is no storyline and the only character on the board is controlled by the player. [CR]* Like in the previous game, each character has his/her own unique voice. The European version features less voice tracks and the USA version features a single voice track for all characters.[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* Play as Father Strength : At the character select screen, highlight Strength, hold C and press A or B. This trick does not work nor in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode. [CR]* Play with bonus characters : At the character select screen, highlight any character (Except World, World's number is 21 so she can't be used for this trick) and wait until the timer counts down to the number assigned to that character : [CR]00 - Fool [CR]01 - Magician [CR]02 - High Priestess [CR]03 - Empress [CR]04 - Emperor [CR]05 - Hierophant [CR]06 - Lovers [CR]07 - Chariot [CR]08 - Strength [CR]11 - Justice [CR]13 - Death [CR]15 - Devil [CR]17 - Star [CR]19 - Sun [CR]20 - Judgment [CR]Then push C only three times. Moon, Hanged Man, Hermit, Temperance, Tower and Fortune will appear and will now be selectable. This trick does neither work in puzzle mode nor in adventure mode. [CR]* Secret Stages : [CR]1) Moon (after Level 6) : Finish the sixth stage without exceeding 90 seconds since the beginning. [CR]2) Hanged Man (after Level 6) : Finish the sixth stage exceeding 300 seconds since the beginning. [CR]3) Black Pierrot (after Level 10) : Finish the tenth stage with at least 150000 points.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Magical Drop (1995, Arcade)[CR]2. Magical Drop Plus 1! (1995, Arcade)[CR]3.

				<title_clean>Puzzles - Motos</title_clean>
				<plot>Motos (c) 1985 Namco.[CR]The object of the game is to bump your enemies - space bugs - off the solar base using Motos, your ship. When you bump all of them off, you move to the next base or round. If Motos is knocked off the base, you lose one life. The game is over when you lose all your lives.[CR]You can collect Power parts and Jump parts lying on the solar base by simply having Motos touch them. The collected parts will be displayed in the lower left corner of the screen and you can use them in the next round. Motos can be outfitted with no more than seven power parts; the more power parts added, the more powerful Motos is. However, Motos can only be outfitted with only one jump part per round. With a jump part, Motos can jump over two squares by moving the joystick in the desired direction and pressing the Jump button. One jump on a square cracks the square and a second jump in the same spot makes a hole in the solar base.[CR]You can outfit Motos with these parts in the Power Parts or Jump Parts screen displayed at the beginning of each round. Select the number of parts you want by moving left and right with the joystick, and lock them in place by pressing the Jump button. You can use the selected parts for one round only; they will not be available in subsequent rounds.[CR]Linger too long on the playing field and Shooting Stars will begin to fall periodically onto the solar base. The Stars are aimed at Motos, and when they miss they crack a square or break a hole in the solar base (like they do to the base behind the Motos logo in the attract mode's title sequence).

				<plot>Puzz Loop (c) 1998 Mitchell.[CR]Puzz Loop is a puzzle game for one or two players in which different coloured marbles continually roll down a spiral path towards a central goal line.[CR]Players control a rotating cannon situated at the center of the spiral and must stop the line of marbles from reaching the goal by shooting matching coloured marbles into the line. If three or more marbles of the same colour are matched, they will disappear.[CR]In addition to standard marbles, bonus marbles occasionally appear that will, for example, temporarily slow down the rate the marbles' advance, or cause all marbles of a certain colour to be destroyed. Also, providing there is a clear line of sight, unwanted marbles can be fired straight out of the play area to prevent them from adding to the advancing line.[CR]All marbles must be destroyed to complete a level.

				<title_clean>Puzzles - Qix</title_clean>
				<plot>Qix (c) 1981 Taito Corp.[CR]The objective of Qix is to claim a certain proportion of the playing field as your own. At the start of each level, the playing field is just a large, empty rectangle, containing the Qix - a stick-like entity that performs peculiar, erratic motions within the confines of the rectangle. The player controls a small marker that can move around the edges of the rectangle. To claim an area of the screen, the player must detach from an edge and draw Stix within the rectangle. Stix are simply lines traced out by moving the marker. When the marker traces out a closed shape, the area enclosed by the shape becomes solid and has been claimed. The player may draw either Fast Stix, which appear blue when solid, or Slow Stix, which appear red. Slow Stix take longer to draw, but are worth twice as many points. Once the player has claimed an area, the marker can safely move along the border of that claimed area. To complete a level, the player must claim 75% or more of the rectangle's area.[CR][B]Technical[/B][CR]Board Number : LKN00003[CR]Prom Stickers : LK / QQ / QU / QX[CR]Main CPU : (2x) M6809 (@ 1.25 Mhz)[CR]Sound CPU : M6802 (@ 921.6 Khz)[CR]Sound Chips : Discrete[CR]Players : 2[CR]Control : 4-way joystick[CR]Buttons : 2 (SLOW, FAST)[CR][B]Trivia[/B][CR]Qix was released in October 1981.[CR]Also released as a cocktail model. In Japan, the cocktail version is known as "T.T Qix". [CR]The author named the game 'QIX' (pronounced 'KICKS' and not 'QUIX') because his car registration/number plate at the time was : 'JUS4QIX'.[CR]Qix is the first 'drawing game', a truly original game. Also the first totally Taito American game, Qix initially did big numbers, but quickly died when players discovered the machine was 'unbeatable'. Having a googolplex of possible combinations, there was no singular pattern to the game and players lost interest.[CR]A Qix unit appears in the 1983 movie 'Joysticks' and in the 1984 movie 'The Karate Kid'.[CR][B]Scoring[/B][CR]There are a couple of ways you earn points in Qix. The first involves actually claiming areas.[CR]There are 2 buttons, slow and fast. These buttons determine how fast your Marker goes. In essence, going slow increases the risk of losing your Marker so it is obviously worth more points. Here's how the points work out for making 'boxes':[CR]1) Slow : It is a base 500 points multiplied by the percentage of area covered by that box. For example, if you create a box that claims 3% of the total area, then points scored would be 500 X 3 or 1500 points. This area fills in with brown.[CR]2) Fast : It is a base 250 points multiplied by the percentage of area covered by that box. For example, if you create a box that claims 1% of the total area, then points scored would be 250 X 1 or 250 points. This area fills in with blue.[CR]NOTE : The above points may not be exact since the game rounds off the percentages to whole numbers for display but calculates them using decimal percentages.[CR]You also get bonus points for going above the 75% Threshold. Any percentage above the 75% Threshold is multiplied by 1000 to determine your bonus points.[CR]During the split Qix screens, if you successfully split the Qix's into their own compartments, you will get a multiplier bonus that is applied to points scored when you are making boxes. For example, if you had a 250 points and the multiplier was 3X, you now have 750 points. This multiplier increments by one every time you successfully split the Qix's. Of course, when you do this, you don't get the bonus points (if you had any).[CR][B]Tips and Tricks[/B][CR]* When you start the game, your Marker will be at the bottom, middle of the playing screen. It is now up to you to start creating boxes. Keep in mind that you need to be constantly moving or the Sparx will take out your Marker. In addition, when you are moving your Marker around the perimeter, you can only move along the perimeter actually touching the Playing Field.[CR]* First of all, you must be constantly aware of two things. First, you must know where the Qix is located at all times. It moves randomly and can go anywhere on the Playing Field that your boxes haven't blocked. Last, the Sparx are constantly moving around the perimeter of the Playing Field. This can set up a dangerous situation where one Sparx is coming at you from one way and another from the other to make your Marker a 'Sparx Sandwich'.[CR]* Once you have assessed the danger, it is time to start making boxes. There are a few things to note when you are making boxes :[CR]a) When you start to draw the line, the Sparx cannot travel along the new perimeter you are creating until it is filled in.[CR]b) The Qix, though, is your primary concern. If it touches any part of a line before the box is filled in, you will lose your Marker.[CR]c) The box must begin and end either at a filled box or on the side of the Playing Field. You cannot connect the line to itself. If you try to do this, you will go into what is called a 'Spiral Death Trap' and a Fuse will follow your line to your Marker and destroy it.[CR]* After the fourth wave, the Qix will split in two. Now you have 2 Qix's bouncing around to deal with. You major goal is to actually 'split' the Qix's into their own areas. This means creating a series of boxes so that each Qix will be in its own compartment.[CR]* For maximum points, you must do two things :[CR]a) First, use the slow button as much as possible since this is where the points are.[CR]b) Try to claim as much area in each box as possible. That percentage multiplied by the speed value can yield some big point values.[CR]c) Constantly try to split the Qix's (if you can) to get that bonus multiplier even higher.[CR]d) When you are close to the Threshold, find an area in the Playing Field that hasn't really been touched and try to make a big box. That way, you will go over the 75% Threshold and claim a bonus.[CR]* As the waves progress, everything gets faster and the game will become less forgiving if you are less then committed to making a box.[CR]* Also, listen for sounds in this game. The only real sound you need to be concerned with is what sounds like a fuse being lit. If you are making a box and you hear this sound, that means you are taking too long or you have unfortunately gotten yourself into a 'Spiral Death Trap'. In the case of delay, once you move the fuse will go out.[CR]* To maximize points, draw narrow, tall boxes, like fingers, from the bottom.  When the Qix goes down between two fingers, go across the top of the fingers at slow speed. This tactic permits percentages of up to 99%.[CR]* It is possible create a 'slide-box' to avoid the sparks. Starting at a corner of a box, draw another box that connects only at that corner. When a spark approaches, the player can slide the diamond through the intersection, while the spark has to go around the perimeter. After the spark passes the intersection, the player can slide back across the intersection and be behind the spark.[CR][B]Game Series[/B][CR]1. Qix (1981, ARC)[CR]2.

				<title_clean>Puzzles - Puzzle Uo Poko</title_clean>
				<plot>Puzzle Uo Poko (c) 1998 Cave.[CR]Uo Poko is a puzzle game for one or two players (co-operative). The aim is to clear the screen of coloured glass balls by dropping like-coloured balls down onto them. Connecting three or more like-coloured balls creates a chain reaction and causes them to disappear.[CR]Balls are launched into the play area via a joystick controlled 'pinball-plunger' and as in Pinball, the further the plunger is pulled back, the further the coloured ball will travel. Mastering the strength and distance required is essential in order to drop each ball accurately onto its target. To allow players to learn how to use the plunger, the first two stages feature a guide line which shows exactly where a ball will drop.
